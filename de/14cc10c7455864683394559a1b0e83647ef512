Looking into finally eliminating kgio for unicorn 6.x and
requiring Ruby 2.3+ for "accept_nonblock(exception:false)"

Not sure about eliminating raindrops, it's got other useful (but
Linux-only) properties which can't go into the Ruby VM...

I'm always several years behind the world on Moore's law(*), but
maybe double/triple-digit CPU core/thread counts are common
amongst some users, here; so raindrops might help bigger systems.


But I also believe software projects should always remain usable
to whatever hardware the author started the project with(**).
For me, that's actually a fairly impressive (for my standards :P):
800 MHz-1.6 GHz Pentium-M (32-bit, single core).  Of course I
have ssh/mosh access to more powerful systems.

But yeah, compiling C-extensions (or anything) is a drag on the
Pentium-M...

(**) yes, I believe Ruby should remain usable on hardware
     matz started Ruby with in the early/mid-nineties.
