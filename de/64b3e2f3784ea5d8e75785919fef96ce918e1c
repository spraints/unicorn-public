preload_app is false by default because it's the most likely to work
for all gems.

I suspect there's a shared resource (file/socket) or some cached value
that's initialized before fork and loses state after forking.

It's a fairly common issue with database libraries

I would definitely contact the maintainer of logging/logging-rails
on how to reinitialize any state after forking.
