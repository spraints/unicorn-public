That's fine.

Does your application fork processes?  It may not be reaping
them.   Are your normal unicorn workers dying, too?

You can check the process tree or periodically run "ps" to see
what was running as the reaped pid before it died.

I use "ps axf" from the "procps" package on some Linux sytems;
or "pstree" if installed to see the process tree.
