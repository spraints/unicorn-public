I'm not very knowledgeable about bundler, but app servers probably
should not be in any packaged Gemfile at all.

"Official statements" do not have much weight behind them; history does.

They can look at the git history (especially that of manpages and

cruft.

Personally, I intensely dislike "official" things; so people shouldn't
take what I (or anybody) writes as gospel.
