It's probably better to test the listening port unicorn uses
(perhaps setup a generic health check endpoint) via socat/curl
to detect if unicorn is down.

Do you have anything logging to stderr_path?  That might give you a
better idea of what's wrong.  Unfortunately, PID files are always bound
to be racy so perhaps supervisor scripts should test and endpoint of an
app using socat or curl.
