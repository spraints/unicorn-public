Subject: [PATCH 0/2] socket inheritance behavior/bug => feature!
Date: Tue, 27 Oct 2015 03:33:10 +0000

Given long enough, some bugs need to become documented behavior
(see [PATCH 2/2]).

Anyways, I guess we'll release 5.0.0 final in a day or two.  I was
intending to release 5.0.0 today until I noticed how un-DRY having
listeners configured in both systemd and unicorn config files would
be.  And then I noticed we have an existing bug as documented in 2/2
which would allow the user to be DRY after all.

Eric Wong (2):
      sd_listen_fds emulation cleanup
      inheriting sockets from UNICORN_FD does not close them

Fwiw, in case anybody is uncomfortable with the mere mention of the
word "systemd"; unicorn will never have any dependencies on systemd.
It will merely use systemd if available.
