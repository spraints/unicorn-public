Maybe we follow semver...

No, I'd rather not mention it on the homepage or be formally/officially
bound to it (see below)

I have considered it in the past, but decided against it...

unicorn is on the verge of becoming 5.x:

This is for internal changes which some weirdo projects (notably
Rainbows!) rely on; but was never considered public API or marketed
as such.  I absolutely do not want people building server-specific
apps when Rack exists.

Rack will also hit 2.x soon, but regardless of incompatible changes
in Rack, unicorn must remain compatible with both 1.x and 2.x for
practical reasons.

Tying a Rack app to unicorn is totally, completely wrong and defeats the
point of Rack.

Honestly, I could understand tying an app to thin with it's EM-specific
API, but unicorn(!?!?)  Even if an app isn't thread-safe, it should
still work in passenger, thin, or puma/webrick configured for a
single-thread...


Regardless of a formalities such as semver, I'll work to ensure unicorn
can be compatible[1] with any Rack apps in Debian main.
Heck, perhaps Rack 0.9.x still works (assuming the installed Ruby
version supports it).

Just let us know what real problems you find, they will be fixed.

Fwiw, Debian is my preferred platform and I can stay 100% within email
with the Debian BTS + lists.


[1] I would never say unicorn is the best choice for all apps,
    but it should at least limp along with sufficiently loose
    definitions of "working", perhaps with hundreds of inefficient
    processes in some cases.
