No problem!  I basically live and breathe plain-text email,
so Debian is a good fit for me :)

Probably not...  I almost regret making SIGTERM behave like nginx
instead of making SIGTERM identical to SIGQUIT.  OTOH, matching
nginx might make learning to use nginx (after learning unicorn signals)
easier.

I've certainly never used SIGTERM on unicorn or nginx myself.
Occasionally I've managed to break the RubyVM enough to require SIGKILL,
but I think using SIGTERM is unnecessary other than as "training wheels"
for nginx.
