Unicorn *is* in general very good and very efficient, no doubt about that.
Eric Wong has made great design choices and is an excellent programmer.

Having said that, in certain specific cases there's still room for
improvement. That's why we focused so much on microoptimizations and
specific optimizations like turbocaching. Have you followed Phusion
Passenger's Server Optimization Guide?
https://www.phusionpassenger.com/documentation/ServerOptimizationGuide.html

Also, you have to ensure that your Rails app sets the correct caching
headers. By default, Rails sets "Cache-Control: private, no-store" so that
the turbocache cannot kick in. You should see very different results if you
add "headers['Cache-Control'] =3D 'public'" to your Rails app. If you need
any help with this, please feel free to contact me off-list. I'd be happy
to help. We have also a benchmarking kit so that you can double check the
results; email me if you're interested in this.

As Sam said, most of the time will be spent in the Rails app. But
turbocaching is one notable exception: it's the one feature that can speed
things up even if your app is slow - provided that you set HTTP caching
headers correctly.

Unicorn is excellent at what it does: it's a minimal server with a specific
I/O model that is supposed to be used behind a buffering reverse proxy.
There is nothing wrong with that, and for the workloads that it's designed
for, it's great. Phusion Passenger has merely chosen a non-generalist
approach that aims to squeeze additional performance from specific cases.
Of course, nothing's a silver bullet. Like any tool, it only works if you
use it correctly.
