public-inbox supports read-only NNTP access nowadays to make it
easier to follow archives.  It is read-only to encourage Cc:-ing
all participants (which avoids reliance on the few-points-of-failure
behavior of NNTP).  Unlike email, NNTP also lacks good anti-spam
filtering.

Additionally, the gmane group also got redirected to the
bogomips.org address at some point since RubyForge died.

While we're at it, link to my post about enabling the submission
port (587).  It's been a year and nothing bad has happened, yet.

Finally, remove most of the documentation for ssoma since it's
unlikely anybody will use it given the existence of NNTP access.
It did little besides clutter the page.  However, git:// (used
by ssoma) remains strictly more efficient than NNTP.
