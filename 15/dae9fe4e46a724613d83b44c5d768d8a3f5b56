As most of you know, unicorn has always used Ragel for HTTP
parsing (inherited from Mongrel).

For the most part, Ragel works great and does not need much
maintenance.  I made some changes to work with the Ragel 5-to-6
transition for Mongrel (pre-unicorn) and that was it.

Since I mainly use Ragel from the Debian package nowadays,
I missed this bit of news when it was posted 2014-10-24.

| As of October 2014, Ragel will be maintained by Colm Networks. 
| This is a new consulting company founded by Dr. Adrian D.
| Thurston.

(ed: Adrian Thurston is the original author of Ragel)

| Since we cannot operate in the open, the git repository for
| Ragel  will no longer be available. The project will be
| published as release (and pre-release) tarballs only. On the
| upside, Ragel will get much more attention.

*Sigh* I guess we'll need to diff release tarballs from now on...

I'm not very knowledgeable in C++, so any extra help auditing Ragel
changes would be greatly appreciated.

| The license will remain the same: GPLv2 with an exception for
| the generated code derived from Ragel source.

OK, at least that is good to hear.

Fwiw, the ragel-users mailing list (where I lurked) closed in
July 2014, too.

Anyways, I still love Ragel as a tool/language and have used it
in other projects.  For now, it seems to work, but I'm hesitant
to start new projects using it.
