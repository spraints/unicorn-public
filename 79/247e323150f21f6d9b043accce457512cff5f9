Hi Ian,

Unicorn chdirs to the directory returned by `/bin/sh -c pwd` when it was
originally started.  The output of `pwd` *should* be symlink-aware, but
then Solaris /bin/sh is weird.  Can you confirm that it's broken?

You can put the following in your config (outside of the hooks):

  app_root =3D "/var/www/apps/systino_production/current"
  Dir.chdir(Unicorn::HttpServer::START_CTX[:cwd] =3D app_root)

I've been pondering adding a "working_directory" directive to
Configurator, too.  However the START_CTX hash is considered a stable
interface and I recently documented it in
http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Unicorn.html

START_CTX even allows you to switch between different installation paths
for Unicorn[1] and alter command line options that were originally
passed.  Lots of rope there :>

[1] for different Ruby installs/versions,
    or even swap in Rainbows! or vice versa
