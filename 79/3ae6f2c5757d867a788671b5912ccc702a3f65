Cool.

Feel free to use this mailing list for discussion if you want.  Some
folks (a minority, I know) just aren't comfortable with /using/
websites.  (Reading is fine, logins/cookies/JS is not)

I also don't like the wording "Eric Wong's Unicorn" since many people
have contributed to this project (and Mongrel).  I've never had much of
an identity online and I'm trying to minimize that as much as
possible[1]

That's 404-ing on me



[1] The only reason I ever use my name in public is for GPL enforcement
    (and as a deterrent to would-be GPL violators).  Thankfully
    it hasn't come up in a few years (and never for this project).
