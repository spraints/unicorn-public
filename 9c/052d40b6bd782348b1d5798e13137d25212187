Likely a bug in yahns or the OpenSSL configuration of it.

I have also been running some experimental ruby-trunk or
yahns patches related to https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/12126
so maybe I left something out in a deployment[1]...

Which client(s) are you using?

curl, w3m, lynx on both Debian jessie and wheezy all seem fine.

  openssl s_client -connect unicorn.bogomips.org:443 -CApath /etc/ssl/

Also seems fine.  As does the following Ruby snippet:

  require 'uri'
  require 'net/https'
  uri = URI('https://unicorn.bogomips.org/')
  req = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
  res = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
    p http.request(req)
  end

I suppose there will be problems with old clients that can't
handle SNI or newer/stronger encryption.

I've not advertised the https site for unicorn yet;
it's just an experiment at this point[2]

Given the flurry of 1.12.x releases regarding TLS issues in
yahns, it's safe to say there are likely bugs how yahns does
TLS:

  http://yhbt.net/yahns-public/20160229-yahns-1.12.2-unle@shed/t/

Fwiw, here's the OpenSSL SSLContext config I use with yahns 1.12.2

  require 'openssl'
  ctx = OpenSSL::SSL::SSLContext.new
  ctx.cert = OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(IO.read(
    '/etc/ssl/certs/dcvr.yhbt.net.crt'))
  ctx.extra_chain_cert = [ OpenSSL::X509::Certificate.new(IO.read(
    '/etc/ssl/certs/dcvr.yhbt.net.chain.crt')) ]
  ctx.key = OpenSSL::PKey::RSA.new(IO.read(
    '/etc/ssl/private/dcvr.yhbt.net.key'))
  ctx.set_params

I'm really not that knowledgeable when it comes to OpenSSL[3].

Is there a WEBrick or similar pure Ruby config you can mimic
the problem with?



[1] Anyways I'm on yahns 1.12.2, now, my curl check runs
    periodically and never reported any TLS-related error
    in weeks.

[2] And will remain experimental indefinitely given my
    lack-of-trust in both the CA system and the quality
    of OpenSSL itself.

[3] I'm afraid my attempt to use/read the openssl C library
    code back in the the 2000s traumatized me for good :x
