The /etc/init.d/myzippykid is symlinked to /usr/bin/sv which is a 
binary provided by runit.

This is an interesting question. runit appear to be capturing the PID 
of my bundle_wrapper.sh instead of the spawned unicorn process. Since 
this isn't interactive, it probably isn't forwarding the signals to 
Unicorn. After replacing the `bundle $@` with `exec bundle $@`, and 
therefore replacing the process with the unicorn command, it all works 
as intended.

I suppose all it took was that question to jog my memory.

I appreciate your assistance! Here is the complete bundle_wrapper.sh 
wthich implements everything as intended:
#!/bin/bash

source /etc/profile.d/rbenv.sh

exec bundle $@

Since Unicorn doen't seem to be receiving the signals, this would 
explain why the timeout never was hit, and nothing ever exited.
