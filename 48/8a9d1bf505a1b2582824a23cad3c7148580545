How are you determining requests get stuck for up to 7 seconds?
Just hitting the app?

How is the system (CPU/RAM/swap usage) around this time?

Are you using Raindrops::LastDataRecv or Raindrops::Watcher?
(If not and you're on Linux, please give them a try[1]).

Anything in the stderr logs?  Dying/restarted workers might cause
this.  Otherwise, I'd look for unexpected long-running requests
in your Rails logs.

I certainly have not.  Did you perform any other upgrades around this
point?

Can you try reverting to 4.3.1 (or earlier, and not changing anything else)
and see if the problem presents itself there?

Also, which OS/version is this?
