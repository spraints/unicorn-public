Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.5.2 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and *nix
Message-ID: <20191220021515.GA5546@dcvr>
MIME-Version: 1.0

unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Disclaimer:

Due to its ability to tolerate crashes and isolate clients, unicorn
is unfortunately known to prolong the existence of bugs in applications
and libraries which run on top of it.

Consider this just an announcement to inform existing users of a
new version, not something to convince you to switch to something
that set the entire Ruby back decades in terms of concurrency.

Changes:

Thanks to Terry Scheingeld, we now workaround a Ruby bug
and can now run with taint checks enabled:

There's also a few documentation updates and building packages
from source is easier since pandoc is no longer a dependency
(and I can no longer afford the bandwidth or space to install
it).

Eric Wong (7):
      test/benchmark/ddstream: demo for slowly reading clients
      test/benchmark/readinput: demo for slowly uploading clients
      test/benchmark/uconnect: test for accept loop speed
      examples/unicorn@.service: note the NonBlocking flag
      Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/ts/tmpio'
      test_util: get rid of some unused variables in tests
      doc: replace pandoc-"Markdown" with real manpages

Terry Scheingeld (1):
      tmpio: workaround File#path being tainted on unlink
