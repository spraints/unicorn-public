I only saw one issue (proposed fix below).
Did you forget to write about the other?

It looks like the breakage was introduced in
commit 5985dd50a9bd72388dd5ca4886d6dffc083f87d4
("Support default_middleware configuration option")

Does this trivial change to unicorn_rails fix it for you?

If it's local, you can just edit
/Users/viraptor/.rbenv/versions/2.5.3/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/unicorn-5.5.0/bin/unicorn_rails
No need to bother with building a gem.


Fwiw, "unicorn_rails" was only intended for Rails 1.x and 2.x.
Rails >= 3.x can use "unicorn" directly.  But "unicorn_rails"
still needs to be fixed on our end because I can't tolerate
breaking changes to existing deployment scripts.
