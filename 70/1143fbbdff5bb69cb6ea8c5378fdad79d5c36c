I don't think Ruby 2.3+ is even necessary, just yet, nor kgio.
None of these new code paths should be exception-intensive to be
a performance problem.

SOCK_SEQPACKET has worked well on Linux for ages; and seems to
work well on FreeBSD 12+, at least; but I haven't tried it on
other OSes...

socketpair itself is ancient and every *nix has it (but only
SOCK_STREAM and SOCK_DGRAM, SOCK_SEQPACKET came a bit later).

OK, fair enough.

Honestly, you have no idea how embarrased I am of that (mis)feature.

OK, fair enough.  I think it's simpler to tell people to improve
existing hooks than introduce new names for similar concepts
(and likely a chunk of duplicated code in their configs)

OK, your initial message was from Thunderbird and probably close;
so I figure git@vger.kernel.org could use the feedback if the
git manpage has fallen out-of-date.

That would be: https://github.com/casperisfine/unicorn.git

Anonymous HTTPS is mostly fine (more steps to quote/reply to,
and inaccessible offline)

Registration is what I have major problems with.
