I completely agree with that statement.

However, having an app with hard dependency on a specific app server
is not the same a providing a default setup for a given app server.

For example, an app like Gitlab, Discourse or whatever might provide a
default good configuration for Unicorn, a set of optimisations in the
context of a Unicorn (pre/post fork instructions=E2=80=A6) and have somethi=
ng
that works great out of the box, even if it's not restricted to
Unicorn.
Someone who would want to change to Passenger, Puma or else would have
to adapt the configuration and port the optimizations, but the app
would work the same as with Unicorn, without crippled features.
Someone who wouldn't change or tweak anything would have a good
setting by default.
