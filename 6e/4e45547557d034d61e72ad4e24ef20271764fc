OK.  However, the other benefit of the change is that master process
death can be detected much sooner.  (The per-process open file limit
issue doesn't really bother me with my change, since the overall kernel
pipe usage does not change).

I suppose ruby-pg users can do something like:

	trap(:EXIT) { pg.cancel }

if they really want to be able to abort in-progress queries

No worries, I was already using a similar method to (only) detect master
process death in another master-worker server.  Anyways, there's nothing
pg-specific to it and I was always slightly worried signals would cause
some buggy code behave incorrectly in the face of EINTR (though most of
C Ruby + extensions seem well-behaved in that regard).

So I'm likely to go forward with it (if not for unicorn 4.8, then 5.0)

Thanks for bringing this issue to everyone's attention.
