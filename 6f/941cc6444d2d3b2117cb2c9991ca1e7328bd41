This restriction reduces vectors for attacks (hash collision, memory
exhaustion/fragmentation and most importantly: things we have yet to
think of).

I'm against adding configuration parameters hardly anybody needs or
uses.  Its more things in the documentation (too much
documentation/options is confusing for users).  This restriction has
been in more widely deployed servers (e.g.  mongrel/thin) for many years
before unicorn and hardly anybody has an issue with it.

Why do you need to such a long URI?  Do you expect users to follow such
long URLs?  How often do you actually see such long URLs from other
applications, perhaps your app is doing something wrong?

Given the prevalence/popularity of URL shorteners, perhaps using shorter
URLs in the first place is a good idea :)
