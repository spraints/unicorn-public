No, the generated .c file would still be distributed with the
gem as it is today.  I'm absolutely against introducing new
build requirements (optional dependencies, maybe, but not
requirements).

Changing the .rl file might result in ragel running (or emit
warning if ragel isn't installed).  Not too sure how to do that
via mkmf, though...  Or it would just throw a warning and drop a
hint to run "make ragel" at the top-level if the .c file is
missing...

*shrug*  I figure for any one person that posts a comment for
something on any public forum, there's probably 10 that feel the
same way.

Alright, we can experiment with more build system changes
another time another (and I zoned out while writing the 5.7
release notes and forgot to note the minor build system changes
I made right after th 5.6.0 release :x)
