Subject: Re: [PATCH] limit rack version for ruby compatibility

Following up on this, it seems to me like keeping the Ruby 2.2.2
requirement is the right way to go for rack. If the unicorn project
wants to continue support for older rubies, the unicorn gemspec should
be changed to limit the rack dependency to '< 2'. If rack 2.0.0 is
released and there is no limit on the dependency in unicorn's gemspec,
it seems to me like any deployments that are not running Ruby 2.2.2
will fail.

Subject: [PATCH] limit rack version for ruby compatibility

rack introduced a dependency on ruby 2.2.2 or greater in
https://github.com/rack/rack/commit/771d94e5dbe53058160a1f8a4cc56384c1d2a048

In order to maintain support for ruby versions less than 2.2.2, limit
the rack dependency to supported versions for the current ruby.
