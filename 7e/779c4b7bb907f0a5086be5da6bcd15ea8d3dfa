Michael,

Thanks for this - I have since changed the way we are restarting the
unicorn servers after a deploy by changing capistrano task to do:

in :sequence, wait: 30

We have 4 backends and the above will restart them sequentially, waiting
30s (which I think should be more than enough time), however, I still get
the following latency spikes after a deploy: http://goo.gl/tYnLUJ

This is what the individual servers look like for the same time interval:
