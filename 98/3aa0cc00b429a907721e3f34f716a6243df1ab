Hi Eric, thanks for the comprehensive reply. As it happens, shortly after posting this, the problem started again...in the past it's been fairly sporadic, whereas this time it was extremely persistent so we were forced into tracking it down then & there. I ended up replacing unicorn with a single webrick instance, which would serve a few requests then hang...after a long debugging session we finally managed to track down the problem to a hung sphinx instance, which we use for our search engine.  Ruby would try to talk to that and just sit there without ever timing out. I'm going to go through the sphinx code tomorrow and see if I can figure out why that might occur.

Thanks for the help,
Jonathan
