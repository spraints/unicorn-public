I haven't heard any feedback regarding the "gperf"
changes, and I don't think the extra installation
overhead of the gperf command is worth the overhead
since most people will never notice it the improvement.

I also started a "no-kgio-wip" branch at
https://bogomips.org/unicorn.git, but haven't had a consistent
or quiet-enough machine to benchmark and work on it further.

I'm looking forward to the day when I don't need or have any
sort of AOT compiler at all installed on my system, just
interpreters :>
