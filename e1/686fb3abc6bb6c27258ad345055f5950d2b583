[dropping jhass]

He says "It's probably just conflicting opinion, distributing Ruby
applications to untrained people is still uncommon"

jhass: "Adding unicorn to the Gemfile eases installation by taking a
step out of it, allows site local installation of it
(--path/--deployment) and ensures the right version so our
integrations (config/unicorn.rb, config/eye.rb, script/server) don't
break."

With debian packaging, our aim is to get a user setup an application
like gitlab or diaspora, just using the package manager they are
already familiar with. They don't have to know what language it is
written, what framework or application server or what database it is
using, all they are interested is the application specific configuration
.

How much compatibility we can expect for config/unicorn.rb?
