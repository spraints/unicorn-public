The above is exactly what I would do, too.

I would also try to correlate the time of Bus Errors with logs
of when + which requests are failing, and try replaying only
those requests to narrow things down.

Also, do you have core dumps enabled?  Enable those
("ulimit -c unlimited" in sh), and run gdb on them as you get
them.  The .gdbinit in the source tree of the Ruby version
you're using is helpful not just for Ruby itself, but
also C extensions, too.  I'm no a gdb expert, but it's
well-documented and has built-in help.
