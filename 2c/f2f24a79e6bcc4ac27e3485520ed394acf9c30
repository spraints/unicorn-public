I guess this is because the process is too short-lived.  Can you
audit your code for when you spawn applications and check that?

Actually, what is curious is your master process is reaping
these processes (not workers reaping); yet your workers are not
dying and getting reaped.

Are you using preload_app?

If so, do you spawn any background processes at load time?
Or are there any background threads in the master process?

Does the problem go away if you disable preload_app?

Because, in normal applications, workers may spawn background
processes but its rare for the master to spawn anything but
workers themselves.

AFAIK, you cannot detect what it's reaping portably...

You can try the following hack to look for defunct (zombie)
processes before unicorn calls waitpid2.  However, keep in mind
it is subject to race conditions so not 100% reliable:

diff --git a/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb b/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb
index f33aa25..f57271e 100644
--- a/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb
+++ b/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb
@@ -396,6 +396,7 @@ def awaken_master
   # reaps all unreaped workers
   def reap_all_workers
     begin
+      system('ps | grep defunct')
       wpid, status = Process.waitpid2(-1, Process::WNOHANG)
       wpid or return
       if @reexec_pid == wpid



One other thing you try do (on Linux) is strace the master:

	strace -p $PID_OF_MASTER -f -e execve,clone

And see what the master is spawning.  I suppose other OS has
similar functions (truss/ktruss/...)
