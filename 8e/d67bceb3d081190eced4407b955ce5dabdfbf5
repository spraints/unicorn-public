I'd start with the number of threads, since (AFAIK) your CPU implements
HT well (unlike the P4 family).  Modern OSes multitask well, so more
worker processes will always work until it bumps into another limit
(e.g. memory usage, DB connections, disk contention, ...)

You may also want more workers to amortize GC/malloc/free costs anyways.

As always, testing for your particular app is required.

I usually run fewer nginx workers since I don't configure much
CPU/memory-intensive logic in nginx.

However, if you're dealing with large uploads or large responses/static
files which cannot fit into memory, then I suggest having having enough
nginx workers to match (or exceed) your storage device count.
