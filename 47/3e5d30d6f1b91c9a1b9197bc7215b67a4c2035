The connection is kept during any socket I/O and application processing.

unicorn doesn't handle persistent connections, though, so it'll always
drop the connection when its done writing the response.

You should be able to test and verify yourself by:

1) writing an intentionally slow endpoint in your app
2) starting a request to that slow endpoint
3) sending SIGHUP
4) the slow endpoint should finish
5) the workers will gracefully exit and restart

No problem :>
