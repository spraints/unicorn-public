The only thing that matters in the end is whether the code is good or not.

I have the same likelyhood of having my GPG key compromised as I do of
writing broken code that breaks things horribly: a very likely one.

I make my commits public and and send patches to mailing lists to
encourage others to verify what I'm doing isn't horribly broken.  I
never tell anybody to accept patches/code based on who wrote it; same
goes for gems/tarballs.

So yes, gems/tarballs should have the same level of scrutiny as every
commit.


If somebody else assumed my identity, but continued doing things in the
way I've done in the past; unicorn users would not (nor should they)
notice the difference.  That may've already happened :)
