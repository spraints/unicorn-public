Subject: Unicorn configuration to increase max header size

Hi,

We are using Unicorn as the http server for one of our ruby applications
and we recently encountered an issue that some browsers won't limit the
cookie size so we will get requests with http header greater than 8k and
users are receiving "400-bad request". Is there a way to increase the
maximum allowed header size? I searched online but didn't find a lot of
useful information on it.

Thanks,
Jim Zhan
