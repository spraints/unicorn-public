Hi I=F1aki,

No way to determine that currently, as I've never encountered the need.

For validating startups, most folks I know have specific endpoint(s) in
application dedicated to checks.  That way they can get way more info
and all the way down into stack including things like database/memcached
connections.

Anything less is superficial because they can fail to detect other
misconfigurations (including stuff like wrong RAILS_ENV); not just
startup errors.

I'm generally hesitant to introduce code/features/bloat that aren't
helpful to people who properly test configurations before deploying :)

Adding this code doesn't solve problems.  Either way the site can become
inaccessible/unusable and problems are noticeable very quickly.

If there's sufficient interest, I'll consider accepting a small patch
for this.  Right now I'm unconvinced...

We avoid introducing command-line options since they're unlikely to be
compatible with "rackup" parsing of the "#\" lines in .ru files.
