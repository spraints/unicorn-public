This is the correct place :)  Plain-text email is the only way I
handle support for ease-of-archival and distribution.

This sounds like a database (or any other persistent connection
backend) connection expiring due to an idle timeout.

This could also be a firewall/router timeout problem between the
server running unicorn and the database host.

Tony experienced this last year:

You can confirm by running lsof on a worker processes to look for
open sockets.  In case the connection loss isn't noticed by the
OS, use strace (or any other similar syscall tracer for your OS)
instead and watch connection activity.

With strace (or similar) knock yourself down to one worker
process via SIGTTOU to the master to ensure you're always tracing
the correct one.

By the way, this is not recommended for slow clients.
nginx (Open Source edition) is currently the only supported proxy.

I suggest disabling any idle timeout you might have, enabling TCP
keepalive and enabling reconnects (see AR and your database driver
documentation).  Worst case (firewall/router problem you can't
fix via configuration), is to send a request to unicorn every
few minutes/hours to keep things going.

Perhaps OathKeeper has the same problem, too...
I've never heard of it until now.
