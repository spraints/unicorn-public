Doesn't Rails favor RAILS_ENV over RACK_ENV?  unicorn ignores RAILS_ENV
(unicorn_rails respects RAILS_ENV, but unicorn_rails isn't recommended
for modern (Rack-enabled) Rails)

Is there a benefit which RACK_ENV=development gives you for Rails
that RAILS_ENV=development does not give you?

Fwiw, the times I worked on Rails, I used customized dev environments
anyways, so I would use RAILS_ENV=dev_local or RAILS_ENV=dev_$NETWORK
for switching between a localhost-only vs networked setup.

I don't see how this hook has benefits over putting this in config.ru
(or somewhere else in your app, since your app is already loaded...)

I'd imagine users wanting the same app-wide settings going between
different application servers, too.

I'm against adding more command-line or config options, especially
around loading middleware.  RACK_ENV is already a source of confusion,
and Rails also has/(or had?) it's own middleware loading scheme
independent of config.ru.

git format-patch + git send-email is the recommended way if your
mail client cannot be taught to leave formatting alone.  Also this
is easy for sending multiple patches in the same thread.

git format-patch --stdout with a good mail client which will not wrap
messages is also great (especially for single patches).

Attachments (generated using git format-patch) for text/x-diff should be
accepted by Mailman.  Attached patches are a last resort, I prefer
inline patches since I can quote/reply to them inline.

(same patch submission guidelines as git or Linux kernel)

Commit messages should explain why a change is made/needed, not just
what it does.
