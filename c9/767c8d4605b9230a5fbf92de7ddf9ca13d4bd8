Subject: Re: [PATCH] limit rack version for ruby compatibility
From: Adam Duke <adamduke@twitter.com>

Is it reasonable to assume that any rack release that includes bumping
the ruby requirement to 2.2.2 would require a major version bump of
rack?

The dependency in the unicorn gemspec could be as simple as '< 2' if
that is the case.
