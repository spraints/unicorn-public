Eric,

It's been a couple of months since the 5.5.0 preview release.  Other the
the change to use rb_gc_register_mark_object, there haven't been any
changes since.  I know you don't have much time for Ruby currently, but
would it be possible for you to release 5.5.0 in the next couple weeks?

Thanks,
Jeremy
