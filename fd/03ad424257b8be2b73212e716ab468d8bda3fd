Right, Debian has Recommends/Suggests: fields for soft dependencies; but
I still consider that overkill.

Perhaps there could be per-server Debian packages such as:

	gitlab-webrick  (should be the default)
	gitlab-puma
	gitlab-passenger
	gitlab-unicorn
	...

Given unicorn has always required the use of nginx for exposure to
public clients, unicorn is perhaps the worst choice as a default
server for people unwilling to read documentation and edit config
files.
