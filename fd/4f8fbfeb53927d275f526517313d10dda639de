Thank you very much for your fast reply. I'm not using Bundler to
manage my dependencies, but I checked it and there's not any conflict
between gem versions.
Seems that I solved the issue removing some of the gems. This was my gem list:

    cuba -v 3.8.0
    slim -v 3.0.8
    cutest -v 1.2.3
    rack-test -v 0.6.3
    sequel -v 4.46.0
    pg -v 0.20.0
    shotgun -v 0.9.2
    shield -v 2.1.1
    sequel_pg -v 1.6.19
    unicorn -v 5.3.0
    capistrano-rbenv -v 2.1.1

And I finally removed these gems:

    cutest -v 1.2.3
    rack-test -v 0.6.3
    shotgun -v 0.9.2
    sequel_pg -v 1.6.19

I suspect that the conflicting gem was 'sequel_pg' (sequel_pg
overwrites the inner loop of the Sequel postgres adapter row fetching
code with a C version. The C version is significantly faster than the
pure ruby version that Sequel uses by default), but given I didn't
remove these gems one by one I can't completely ensure that.

If the problem reemerges I'll keep you informed.

Thanks!! :)
