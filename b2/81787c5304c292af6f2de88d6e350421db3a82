Thanks for the info.  I've added Jeremy Evans, the author of
sequel_pg to the Cc: even though I think he reads this list...

Anyways, I think I've spotted one potential bug in sequel_pg
w.r.t. RB_GC_GUARD usage, and the fix is below:

  git clone https://github.com/jeremyevans/sequel_pg && cd sequel_pg
  curl https://80x24.org/spew/20170714210918.3332-1-e@80x24.org/raw | git am

(more in-depth explanation is in the commit message)

Pere: perhaps you can give it a shot

Keep in mind I've only compile-tested this.  I didn't find
automated tests in the code and I don't have a usable Postgres
instance, at the moment.
