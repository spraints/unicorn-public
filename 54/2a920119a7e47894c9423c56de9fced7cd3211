Unless you find something out-of-the-ordinary with lsof,
we'd have to pull apart your apps to see what they're doing.

I just tested my hello world app (inactive for ~45 minutes) and
could not reproduce the error.

Did you try strace-ing for 30 minutes and reproducing the error?

I'm running out of ideas...

Perhaps your NTP setup is broken?  Or even hardware clock failure
(one of my machines hit that a few weeks ago).
