Subject: Monitoring active/idle unicorn process stats

Hi!

Is it possible to query the number of busy/idle unicorn workers? For
scaling purposes, I would like to be able to see the utilisation of
the unicorn workers, so I will know if I need to deploy more servers
in peak hours or not. Currently the only measure I have is when
machines top out and start serving 502's. I am not interested in
queueing up requests, as the approach is to instead spin up additional
capacity when needed.

I notice on http://demo.nginx.com/status.html that one of the metrics
under 'demoupstreams' is the number of active connections. I wonder if
that metric is exposed by nginx somehow, or if this is something only
available in nginx plus. Suggestions for alternative approaches to
this is appreciated. Ideally, I would like a metric that I can consume
and pump into our monitoring tools with a fairly high resolution.

Cheers,
Christian
