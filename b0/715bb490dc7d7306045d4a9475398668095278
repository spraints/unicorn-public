USR2 should not change environment variables besides UNICORN_FD
and PWD (if working_directory is used).

On most Linux versions, you can check the initial environment of a
running process by inspecting the environ file for the process:

	tr '\0' '\n' < /proc/$PID/environ

This may not reflect environment changes after the process is started.

However, you can use ENV inside Ruby code to check that.  Maybe add a
private Rack endpoint to show ENV.inspect output to your app to check
this...
