Wait, based on what you say below, is this happening to unicorn or
nginx?

So nginx is complaining about disconnected clients, not unicorn,
correct?

Correct, rails/unicorn won't know if the client disconnected until
nginx breaks the connection to unicorn.

nginx fully buffers both requests and responses by default.

That's the whole point of using nginx with unicorn.  nginx shields
unicorn from slow clients.
