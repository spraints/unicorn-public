hello,

i recently set up a new server upon which i installed nginx to try it out (and which i have been quite happy with since).

my website is mostly static with some small cgi areas, and i like to use ruby for the cgi. when i did my research for the best ruby cgi handler for nginx, unicorn figured prominently in my results, and so i became interested in trying it. i spent some time reading up on how to configure and use it but have been unsuccessful implementing, mostly i believe due to the fact that i do not have a rails framework installed nor a legitimate rackup config.ru

my question is this: does it make any sense at all to use unicorn as a ruby cgi handler if i am not also using rails? and if there is indeed some sense in this idea, how might i go about it? is there a simple rackup file that would work for a configuration such as this? i couldn't find any information on rackup configs of this sort, and not being familiar with rails the terrain simply became to steep at this point to continue without some guidance or assurances.

thank you for your consideration.

sincerely,
nomad
