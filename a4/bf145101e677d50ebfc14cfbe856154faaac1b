Not really, the pid file is only for the master process.  The master
always stays as the user it is started as (root in your case).  Only the
worker processes have their user:group changed and they can't signal the
master after the change.

Strange, wouldn't the monitors /not/ daemonize and thus be able to use
the pid of the process they started?

No problem.  Signups/logins/passwords bother me, and I also dislike
99.999% of HTML, images, and JavaScript on the web; so I'll be sticking
to mailing lists :)
