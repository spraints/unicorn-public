Can you mention the recommended way of adding unicorn in a Gemfile in
your home page?

gitlab and diaspora has unicorn in their Gemfile, for a user they want
gitlab or diaspora and they don't care if its using unicorn or puma or
passenger.

I need some kind of an official statement about compatibility which I
can show to projects like gitlab and diaspora, so they don't insist on
exact patch release of unicorn. I could patch the Gemfile, but that
adds extra burden on me as a maintainer which I'd like to avoid if
possible.
