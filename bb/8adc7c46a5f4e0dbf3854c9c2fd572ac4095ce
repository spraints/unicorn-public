nginx handles slow clients extremely well.

How big are you talking about and how much RAM do you have for your OS
page cache?  Big uploads are OK if you have enough memory for caching in
Linux (or fast SSDs).  The Linux page cache is very effective if you can
process the data fairly quickly.

If your clients are very slow and uploads cannot fit in the Linux
page cache, lower your vm.dirty_* knobs (see kernel docs) to force
earlier write-out so you don't get a thundering herd of disk activity
when you run out of RAM.

I don't know about caching in other OSes.

My earliest deployments of unicorn (on a LAN) handled several terabytes
of uploads every day, so working with big uploads has always been
a priority.

The reason unicorn+nginx works well (or at all) is the attention paid to
data costs:

* Ruby processes are expensive, tens to hundreds of megabytes each
* client connections are cheap, several kilobytes at most
  (including kernel data structures)
* networks are slow, so most clients trickle

Thus we spend more time buffering in places where things are cheap, and
spend as little time holding on to big Ruby processes as possible.

.. And thus intense dislike of bloated HTML, top-posting and giant
signatures is directly tied to my software design philosophy.
