Hi Andreas,

This is a bug in Ruby and I've filed a report and patch in Redmine:

 http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/3451

Unicorn needs to fchmod(2) it as the regular user for the heartbeat
functionality to work (master process continues to run as root
if started as root).

Is Unicorn actually able to serve requests when you removed tmp.chown?
Under Linux, fchmod() doesn't work without ownership of the file.

Btw, for Unicorn 2.0, the fchmod()-based heartbeat implementation will
be a fallback only.  I'll be relying on the mmap() + atomic counters code
of Raindrops[1][2].  mmap() + atomic counters was my first choice
anyways, but I didn't want to write more C at the time.

> Please cc replies since I'm not subscribed to the list, thanks.

No problem :>


[1] - The mmap()/atomic counters parts of Raindrops should be portable
      to modern POSIX-ish systems.  I'll probably use libatomic-ops or
      similar if gcc isn't available.
