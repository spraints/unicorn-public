Subject: [PATCH] http_response: clear header buffer before response body iteration
Date: Thu, 23 Feb 2017 18:07:49 +0000
Message-Id: <20170223180749.29081-1-e@80x24.org>
List-Id: <unicorn-public@bogomips.org>

To alleviate some memory pressure during response body
iteration, rely on String#clear to free(3) memory used for the
large header buffer.  Given the size of some response headers
such as cookies, this can release several kilobytes of malloc
heap memory for immediate use by other layers of the application
stack.
