We would need to migrate again if/when that provider goes dead or
service starts deteriorating.  Ease-of-migration and being forkable
again in the future was the top priority.

If I'm hit by a bus or start allowing too much spam, it should be
trivially easy to migrate the project[1] and all its archives and
infrastructure.

I will probably take the addresses of active subscribers who've posted
here[2] imported into the new delivery system, even.

It would be great to be able to make the list of ML subscribers public,
too, to ensure forkability.  I'm not sure how the lurkers will react to
that, though...


[1] of course, whoever takes over may not be a Free Software zealot
    like myself.
[2] those addresses are already public, but lurkers will probably
    have to resubscribe (or use ssoma or the Atom feed).
