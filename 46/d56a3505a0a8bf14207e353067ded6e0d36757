I'm no fan of this or auto-tuning systems in general.

This adds more complexity to configuration: increasing the
likelyhood of getting these numbers completely wrong.  GC and
malloc tuning is tricky and error-prone enough, already.

Mainly, this tends to hide problems for later; instead of
forcing you to deal with your resource limitations up front.

It becomes more difficult to forsee resource limitations down
the line.  Before I worked on unicorn, I've seen auto-scaling
Apache workers mistuned far too often and running out of DB
connections or memory; and that happens at the worst time:
when your site is under heavy load (when you have the most to
lose (or gain)).

My philosophy remains to tune for the worst case possible.

If you really need to do something like run an expensive
off-peak cronjob, maybe have it TTIN at the beginning and TTOU
again at the end.

Fwiw, the most useful thing I've found TTIN/TTOU for is cutting
down to one worker so I know which one to strace when tracking
down a problem; not auto-scaling.

Fwiw, my position has been consistent on this throughout the years.

Also, digging through the archives, Ben Somers came up with
alicorn a while back and it might be up your alley:
