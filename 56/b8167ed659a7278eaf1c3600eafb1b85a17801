You're going to have to analyze your app and all is dependencies
to figure this out; but it's generic Ruby knowledge to fix and
the problem is all over the place...

I get angry as hell when it comes to memory usage but there's
not a lot I can do besides rant(*) and try to fix some things
which come along:

http://blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp/cgi-bin/scat.rb/ruby/ruby-talk/438700

There's more Ruby itself can do (some I intend to work on later
this year); but nothing is going to save you if the apps do wacky
things like load hundreds of thousands of rows from a DB into
memory or try to process giant files all at once.

A lot of of it is mentality: It starts like things like turning
off HTML in your mail client (which roughly triples the size of
mail) and forcing yourself to test and develop against old
hardware on slow connections.


(*) Even 230M is too much IMHO:
