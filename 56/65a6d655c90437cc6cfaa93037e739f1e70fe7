Hi Eric,

I thought I'll wait a few days before replying just to make sure: 
believe it or not, since I upgraded 4 days ago to kgio 2.4.1 not once 
did I run into this issue. While before that unicorn would timeout at 
least once every hour, sometimes a dozen times in a row.

I don't run through nginx on my dev machine, just straight into 
unicorn_rails using mostly Chrome 11 and FF 4. I use:

ruby 1.8.7 (2010-04-19 patchlevel 253) [i686-darwin10.4.0], MBARI 
0x6770, Ruby Enterprise Edition 2010.02



Cheers,
Lawrence
