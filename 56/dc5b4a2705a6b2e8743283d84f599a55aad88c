Hi, I'm not sure what size of requests and responses you get, but 2mb
seems like a lot, especially for requests (unless you handle a lot of
big uploads).

Even with large requests/responses, huge buffers means more pressure on
the kernel allocator and you're also hurting CPU cache locality.  So
larger buffers can hurt performance as well as help, I'll make a note of
that in the documentation.

The backlog shouldn't change performance much.  A larger one can let you
withstand short traffic bursts and increase reliability while
benchmarking.

You're welcome!
