Only send SIGUSR2 to the master, leaving you with two masters and two
sets of workers.  Skip (automated) sending of SIGTTOU signals to lower
worker count to the old master.

Eventually, you'll decide to send SIGQUIT to the old master to stop
it (or the new one, if you decide the new code is broken).

You can still combine this with SIGWINCH (or SIGTTOU) to stop traffic
flow to the old master, too.

Thanks for following up on your logrotate/eye issue, by the way.
