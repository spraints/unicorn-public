Can you check if the signal is received in the master via truss/dtruss?

Do other signals (USR1, HUP, QUIT) work?

You might need to enable the equivalent of "-f" for strace (follow child
processes/threads) since Ruby 1.9 uses a dedicated thread for receiving
signals.

Also, which version of Ruby are you using?  I'm pretty familiar
with the 1.9.3 implementation, the earlier 1.9.x releases were
messier and noisy wrt signal handling.
