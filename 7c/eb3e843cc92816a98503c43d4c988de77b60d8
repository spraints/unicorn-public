Thanks, pushed as c8f06be298d667ba85573668ee916680a258c2c7
to 'master'.  I added a "Fixes: " tag to link it the original.

Hint: you can omit the above line, and add "----8<----" so the
applier can use "git am --scissors" without having to just part
of the message.  It's no big deal, but I guess I'll do what I
can to promote --scissors as it's not too well-known.
(and usually, the entire email is the patch for "git am")
