This affects other Ruby programs which fork().  I suggest
reporting to ruby-core @ https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/ and having
somebody with macOS knowledge look at this(*).

I don't even know how ObjC factors into this.

Thanks for documenting this for other users, at least.
I can't support macOS since I'm not allowed to know
everything about it.



(*) As a smug GNU/Linux user, I get to know EVERYTHING about how
    my system works from the kernel and up, for free!
    And when I do have a question I can't answer on my own;
    all I need to do is email the right people and lists.
    No NDAs or registration of any sort to deal with :>
