Yup, I based the current user interface around the one in nginx to
capitalize on some of my target users' existing familiarity with nginx
and also to (hopefully) lower the barrier of entry for folks new to
both.

Of course I'm not happy with some of the choices nginx made. Using "pid"
instead of "pid_file" in the configuration language really bothers me,
and I completely agree TERM is more logical for graceful shutdowns. But
in the end the nginx UI was "good enough" and consistency won me over.

So things like the init script in examples/init.sh can be adapted to
work for both unicorn and nginx without changing anything other than
path names and some (hopefully few) command-line arguments.


Making user interface choices for for other people isn't something I'm
comfortable with, so I just try to take advantage of what people
already know/expect as much as possible.  I'm lazy in that way :)


For a few weeks (or months now?) I've been debating/avoiding the
"--kill" switch item I have in the TODO (it was requested by a user in
Real-Life(TM)).  I'm still not sure where/how/if it would fit, and
maybe it just doesn't fit.  /me goes on to ponder it a bit more ...
