Yes, there were some fixes in 4.x to improve the timeout accuracy.

Sounds like it.  1.8 and old C extensions could easily lock up the
interpreter on blocking calls.

Another problem could be using new versions of C extensions that are no
longer tested under 1.8.  I admit I haven't tested recent versions of
unicorn/kgio/raindrops on 1.8 lately, either, but I'm _fairly_ sure they
still work since they haven't changed much.

Are you running any different gems/extensions in development vs
production?

What other gems/extensions do you use?
