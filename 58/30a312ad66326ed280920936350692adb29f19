Anything from stderr log files?  USR2 will fail if there's

* compile/load error when loading the app (if preload_app=true)

* unicorn/unicorn_rails executable script is missing
  (maybe Bundler is moving it?)

* Ruby installation got moved/shifted/changed

* Working directory got _moved_ (cap may cycle those out)
  You can set "working_directory" in your unicorn config
  to work around it.

  (and maybe other reasons I can't think of right now)

Come to think of it, the missing working directory case
could be the most common...

But stderr log files (stderr_path) should always tell you what's
going on.

== Linux(-only?) tip:

If the log files got deleted somehow, you may still be able to read it
via: "cat /proc/$PID/fd/2" on either the PID of the master or _any_
worker process.

To read some other log files, you can just replace the "2" with whatever
file descriptor.  Reading the symlinks ("ls -l /proc/$PID/fd/") will
tell you where each descriptor is pointed to, even if it is a deleted
file.
