This is really strange.  This was only really bad for a 7s period?
Has it happened again?  Anything else going on with the system at that
time?  Swapping, particularly...

And if you're inside a VM, maybe your neighbors were hogging things.
Large PUT/POST requests which require filesystem I/O are particularly
sensitive to this.

OK, that probably rules out a bunch of problems.
Just to be thorough, anything interesting in dmesg or syslogs?

RHEL 5.0 or 5.x?  I can't remember /that/ far back to 5.0 (I don't think
I even tried it until 5.2), but don't recall anything being obviously
broken in those...
