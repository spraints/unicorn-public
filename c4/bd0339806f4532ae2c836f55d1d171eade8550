Alright, I guess that third-party gem is no longer relevant.

Thanks, pushed to https://yhbt.net/unicorn.git as
commit 673c15e3f020bccc0336838617875b26c9a45f4e
with Puma noted (see below) and extra `env' check added.

Anything else?  Will wait a few days/week for others to chime in
and probably cut 5.8 in a week or so.

Btw, a sidenote about some strangeness in your mail replies:

  I'm not sure why, but your "Reply-To" header is set to the
  unbracketed Message-ID ("20201209094344.GA25593@dcvr") of the
  message, which makes no sense...

  I wonder if you or your mail client is confusing "Reply-To:"
  with the "In-Reply-To:" header.  They're completely different:
  "Reply-To:" should be an email address you control (not a
  Message-ID) if it differs from what's in the "From:" header.

  In any case, your mail client already sets the "References:"
  header correctly (probably w/o any interaction on your part),
  and the "In-Reply-To:" header is not necessary (and it needs
  angle brackets, anyways, since comments are allowed).

    Add rack.after_reply functionality
    
    This adds `rack.after_reply` functionality which allows rack middleware
    to pass lambdas that will be executed after the client connection has
    been closed.
    
    This was driven by a need to perform actions in a request that shouldn't
    block the request from completing but also don't make sense as
    background jobs.
    
    There is prior art of this being supported found in a few gems, as well
    as this functionality existing in other rack based servers (e.g. Puma).
    
    [ew: check if `env' is set in ensure statement]
