Hi Naresh, do you see anything in the Unicorn stderr log file?

Is the 2mb report part of the response or request?  Unicorn should
have no problems accepting large requests (Rainbows! defaults the
client_max_body_size to 1mb, just like nginx).

It could be Unicorn's internal (default 60s) timeout kicking
in because puppet is slowly reading/generating the 2mb body.

Also, which version of Unicorn and nginx is this?

Having many TIME_WAIT sockets is normal and expected when you're
starting/stopping lots of TCP connections.  It's nothing to worry about
unless you get several thousands of requests/second, and then you should
apply tcp_tw_reuse/tcp_tw_recycle as mentioned in
http://unicorn.bogomips.org/TUNING.html (or switch to UNIX domain
sockets and use nginx for keepalive).
