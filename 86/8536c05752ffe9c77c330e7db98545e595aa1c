Let me quickly tell the other 8.9M projects on GH that they are doing
it wrong ;)

I think having different ways of interacting with every project you
want to work on makes OS harder,
also contributing on PRs is much easier when using some collaboration
tool, viewing the source is easier and patches are simpler to read.
It also encourages nice docs and other things newbies need (does not
really matter for some backend thing like unicorn).

Sure crazy snowflakes like linux kernel might need something
different, but most other giant and small projects do just fine.

This discussion is going nowhere, so let's just stop now ;)
