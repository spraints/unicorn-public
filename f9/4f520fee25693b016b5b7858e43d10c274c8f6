Actually, if the unique URL is in the List-Unsubscribe header,
it won't be accidentally quoted in discussions.
So I just enabled some gory changes which should add a unique,
per-user URL to the List-Unsubscribe: header.

You should see something like the following in your headers:

List-Unsubscribe: <mailto:unicorn-public+unsubscribe@bogomips.org>,
   <https://bogomips.org/u/2my2pvPLJPZlWCLwyy5VMiO9t/unicorn-public>

The https:// link should be one-click, no-confirmation,
unsubscribe which hopefully makes SORBS and similar services happy.
Yes, that's a destructive GET request with no confirmation.

And barely-tested :)

Soon, it will be possible to subscribe using POP3, too,
totally anonymously using a UUID you generate.
It actually makes sense with all the webmail providers which
support it.

HTTPS is also available, as long as Let's Encrypt runs:
https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/

And Tor hidden service:

http://ou63pmih66umazou.onion/unicorn-public/
nntp://ou63pmih66umazou.onion/inbox.comp.lang.ruby.unicorn
torsocks git clone git://ou63pmih66umazou.onion/unicorn # for code

I don't know how stable the hidden service names will be given
how short they are; I know Tor devs are planning a transition
to longer, harder-to-collide ones.
All I know is, there will be more hidden service mirrors.
