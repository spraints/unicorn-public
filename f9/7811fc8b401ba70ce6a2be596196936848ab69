My opinion is that supporting backward compatibility cases that are
clearly poorly designed, at least in open-source software, is
ill-advised.  (I'm referring to the Mongrel compatibility semantics
discussed in that article.)

That aside, I don't yet understand this "need" you're referring to.
The control flow I'm proposing is as follows:

(1) Previous-generation parent (P) receives SIGUSR2.
(2) P renames unicorn.pid to unicorn.oldpid
(3) P forks child (P'); if fork unsuccessful, P renames unicorn.oldpid
to unicorn.pid.
(4) P' calls exec and attempts to start; creates unicorn.pid. P
watches for SIGCHLD from P'.  If received, P renames unicorn.oldpid to
unicorn.pid.
(5) P' sends SIGQUIT to P.  P' unlinks unicorn.oldpid.  P' is now P.

What am I missing here?  This is, to my knowledge, precisely what
nginx does (http://wiki.nginx.org/CommandLine#Upgrading_To_a_New_Binary_On_The_Fly).

That should not happen per (4) above.

Truth be told, I'm not completely certain why this is an issue.  My
reading of procps and the kernel suggests it should be doing the right
thing, but I tried this at first:

- Touch a timestamp file before sending P a SIGUSR2.
- Wait for oldpid to disappear
- Read the stime field from ps(1) for the remaining master process (P or P')
- If stime < mtime of timestamp: new process failed.  If stime >
mtime, new process succeeded.

But for reasons unclear to me, sometimes the stime of P' (successful
reload) would predate the timestamp!  This was obviously agonizing.

With nginx we have -t; we can at least test the config file and have a
reasonable degree of certainty that it will reload properly.  With
Rack apps, not so much. :)
