Perhaps there is a race here, if a worker receives SIGQUIT first, and the
master respawns a new worker before receiving/handling its own SIGQUIT.
This is definitely a longshot, and will probably never happen, but
even then every process will eventually quit gracefully.

I added 'KeepAliveIntervalSec' by mistake. `KeepAlive`, a supported
option by unicorn, is included in jessie (systemd v215). Either way with
your last patch those options are enforced by unicorn.

That would be great! I am a bit surprised that specifying multiple
services ('Service=' option) is not supported.
