Can you consider SemVer from 5.x?

If you can convince gitlab to declare ~> 4.8 and assure it will work with 4.9, that will solve the issue for now.

See https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/issues/2820

Also if you can help convinse diaspora upstream to declare a looser dependency, that will also help.
