Interesting.   Can you try using some other non-Ruby daemon
which uses sd_listen_fds, too?   I can't think of any off
the top of my head, but I'm sure there's some.

It seems like systemd is mis-setting FD_CLOEXEC on socket,
even.

No problem.  I wonder if something else is broken in your systemd
config...

Again, I'll take a harder look at newer systemd later this week
unless somebody beats me to it.
