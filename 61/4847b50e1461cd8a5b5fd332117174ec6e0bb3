It means actions on the terminal which started unicorn won't affect it.
So if the user hits Ctrl-C from the terminal, unicorn will not receive
SIGINT.  Likewise for Ctrl-\ and SIGINT, and if a user resizes his
terminal (common with xterm and friends), there's no SIGWINCH.

setsid(2) is the syscall used to detach from a controlling terminal
(among other things).  Maybe there's documentation elsewhere to the
setsid(2) which explains this part more, but neither the POSIX nor Linux
manpage for that distributed by Debian (wheezy) really explain this.

Patches welcome.  I haven't deployed an app entirely with Capistrano in
years nor do I use any common/widely-known deployment system.  I usually
just end using something like the init script in examples/init.sh
