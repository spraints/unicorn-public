Wow, this is wonderful news!

Great use of the before/after_fork hooks

One possible issue is a race condition in the before_fork hook,
so I'd put a rescue to protect the File.read in the before_fork:

old master                    new master
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
                              before_fork for worker=0
                              File.exist?(old_pid) => true
                              Process.kill :QUIT, File.read(old_pid).to_i

                              before_fork for worker=1
                              File.exist?(old_pid) => true
processes :QUIT
unlinks old_pid
                              # the File.read will raise Errno::ENOENT:
                              Process.kill :QUIT, File.read(old_pid).to_i

Looking forward to it!

Cool, more exposure's always good.

Small nit: "Eric Wong's Unicorn" doesn't sound quite right...
While I am the benevolent dictator for now, I do welcome contributions.

I could not have have built it without standing on the shoulders of
Mongrel and the existence of Rack and nginx.

Personally, I try to keep a low public profile and it's always been an
weird balancing act trying to get people to use my work at the same
time...
