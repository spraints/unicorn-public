Thanks. Did went through Phusion Passenger Enterprise 4 features, you guys =
did neat work Hongli. However the cost of it is driving us to check on alte=
rnate solutions.

Can one signal unicorn to increase workers or just spin new set of workers.=
=A0Any one tried alicorn? https://github.com/bensomers/alicorn.

Provisioning double memory on deploy can be solved differently by spinning =
new server that has upgrade and moving load balancer to divert trafic, the =
netflix way.=A0

Unicorn is designed for short-running requests. Long-running requests
are best taken care of with app servers designed for that purpose, for
example Rainbows! or Phusion Passenger Enterprise 4. Both app servers
can be used in combination with Apache or Nginx. Rainbows! is designed
for a reverse proxy setup while Phusion Passenger Enterprise 4 can
also integrate with the web server.

As far as I know only Phusion Passenger supports dynamic workers.
Unicorn and Rainbows! are both designed for a static number of
workers. Unicorn and Rainbows! allow modifying the number of workers
during runtime through signals, but not automatically according to
traffic as is done by Phusion Passenger.


> b) Can Unicorn be configured to start with zero worker and master spawnin=

s that are not used all the time.

No, because it does not support spawning processes based on traffic.
As far as I know only Phusion Passenger does this.

Yes it does. Although it's possible to change this behavior through a
script that sends signals in a certain order.
