This doesn't seems to be a configuration error or a bug in GitLab.
unicorn itself does not serve files, but just returns what Rack tells
it to do.

But since you're getting 60s timeouts, something seems seriously wrong
with that config; but at least you're on Linux so maybe strace can
help...

Can you try:

1) configuring only single worker process
2) strace that worker process (strace -p $PID_OF_WORKER)
3) send only one request for a JS file to see what's happening?


In any case, if this GitLab instance is meant for any slow/unreliable
client connections outside your LAN, nginx should be serving static
files.  unicorn is grossly inefficient for that (as explained on our
website):
