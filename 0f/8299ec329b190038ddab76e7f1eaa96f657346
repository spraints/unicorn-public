This is just a guess, but we probably want to call the Unicorn.builder
lambda with the same arguments as the rails_builder lambda.

If that doesn't fix it, keep reading.

If after_fork is referencing LoggerSwitcher, and preload_app is not set,
then I think the failure should be expected, as in that case after_fork
is called before build_app!.  That would not explain a regression,
though, as that behavior should have been true in 5.4.1.

Does the problem go away if you switch after_fork to after_worker_ready?
Is preload_app set to true?

Thanks,
Jeremy
