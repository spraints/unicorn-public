You're working inside /releases/28 here...

However, it's trying to run out of /releases/6, which I assume is
old enough to be removed by now.

You should be able to set working_directory in your config/unicorn.rb:

	working_directory "/var/www/hailisys/current"

Then SIGHUP to reload the config before sending SIGUSR2 to it.

Hopefully that works.  Normally you shouldn't need to set
working_directory if you're working out of "/current";
but I'm not sure what your deploy environment looks like.
