Yikes!  ruby-core still supports Ruby 2.1 and possibly even 2.0.0

And there doesn't seem to be any documentation on why Ruby 2.2.x
is needed in the first place for rack.git
commit a2fe30a5e70371c89c1b29fdc2dc5f8027bc5fe6

Interesting, I built a gem with RubyGems 2.5.1 and this conditional
was preserved in the gemspec.  I tried this in the past (2009/2010?)
and any conditionals written like this got clobbered in the final
gemspec.

In other words, conditionals used to be evaluated at "gem build" time,
not "gem install" time.  We should check when this improvement was
introduced into RubyGems should we go this route.

Also, maybe '~> 1.6.4' is too strict, '~> 1.6' could be better in case
a rack 1.7 comes out in parallel to rack 2.0
