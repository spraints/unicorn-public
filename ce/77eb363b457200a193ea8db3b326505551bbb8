What changed recently with your setup?

Which OS/kernel version + vendor version?

Since you've been around a while, I take it this is only a recent issue?

Can you setup a test instance on a different nginx port/unicorn socket
and with a config.ru such as:

------------------------- 8< ----------------------
run(lambda do |env|
  $stderr.write("#$$ starting at #{Time.now}\n")
  # be sure to configure your unicorn timeout
  sleep
  # should not return, wait for unicorn to kill
end)
----------------------------------------------------

And hitting nginx with a single test request to reproduce the issue.

And see if it happens on the same/different hosts where you notice the
problem.
