Eric,

The problem is a firewall that sits between the servers and the database.
 It is an idle session timeout of 30 minutes, so it is silently killing the
connection.  I have reached out to our Network Engineering department but
they are saying they can not change that idle session timeout, nor create a
special rule to allow this connection to bypass that rule.

Currently, I setup a polling device that calls the applications URL every
20 minutes.  This causes the connection between the server and DB to
refresh it's idle timeout.  This is obviously a very hacky way to handle
it, so I am trying to look into AR and Oracle_Enhanced to see if they have
some sort of keepalive option for the database.  I thought it would work
with the reaping_frequency, but apparently that does not work out as I had
expected when you are not running in pools or a thread.  So I'm still on
the lookout for something to handle that.
