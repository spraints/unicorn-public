-===  I've installed Rack 1.1.x, why can't Unicorn load Rails (2.3.5)?
+=== Why aren't my Rails log files rotated when I use SIGUSR1?

+servers such as unicorn.  Buffering in userspace may cause lines to be
+partially written and lead to corruption in the presence of multiple
+processes.  With reasonable amounts of logging, the performance impact
+of autoflush_log should be negligible on Linux and other modern kernels.
