In the very first versions, it was a generic Rack app. And then I
discovered that the file that was transmitted was saved in clear before
being given to the handler (where it would get encrypted)=E2=80=A6
Finding that Rainbows! could be made to process the incoming bytes
directly really helped in fixing this issue.

The choice of tying it to a single HTTP server is also a conscious
decision to make it easy to install. On Debian, it only requires
`apt-get install coquelicot` and then 3 lines in Apache configuration.
