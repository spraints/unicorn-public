Thanks, applied.  Not sure if it's worth making a new release
to fix a test case, so I might wait a bit and see if there's
other stuff.

Also curious, how long do folks intend to continue using 1.9.3?

I don't care for whatever ruby-core claims to support, I know
realistically some folks (including distros) continue using older
versions for a while and I'll do my best to support them.
