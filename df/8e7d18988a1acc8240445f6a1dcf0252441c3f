Actually, another potential issue is DNS lookups timing out.  But they
shouldn't take *that* long...

I proactively audit every piece of code (including external
libraries/gems) loaded by an app for potentially blocking calls (hits to
the filesystem, socket calls w/o timeout/blocking).   I use strace to
help me find that sometimes...

As an experiment, can you replay traffic a few minutes leading up to and
including that 7m period in a test setup with only one straced worker?

Run "strace -T -f -o $FILE -p $PID_OF_WORKER" and see if there's any
unexpected/surprising dependencies (connect() to unrecognized addresses,
open() to networked filesystems, fcntl locks, etc...).

You can play around with some other strace options (-v/-s SIZE/-e filters)

Maybe you'll find something, there.
