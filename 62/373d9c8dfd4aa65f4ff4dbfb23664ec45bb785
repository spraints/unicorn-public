No.  Never.  Github is proprietary communications tool which requires
users to accept a terms of service and login.  That gives power and
influence to a single entity (and a for-profit organization at that).

Contributing to unicorn is *socially* as easy as contributing to git or
the Linux kernel.  There is no need to signup for anything, no need to
ever touch a bloated web browser.

The reason I contribute to Free Software is because I am against any
sort of lock-in or proprietary features.  It absolutely sickens me to
encounter users who seem to be incapable of using git without a
proprietary communications tool.
