Sorry about the confusion, I'll try to clarify...

You use ssoma[1] to to import mail into your inbox.  This is like how
slrnpull works with NNTP or getmail/fetchmail works with POP.  It's
only a one-way sync, but you can import it into an IMAP folder.

Currently there's no SMTP delivery component, but I could probably set
one up this week if there's enough demand for one.  The subscriber list
will be public, though.

	# to initialize a maildir (this may be a new or existing maildir,
	# ssoma will not touch existing messages)
	# If you prefer mbox, use mbox:/path/to/mbox as the last argument
	# You may also use imap://$MAILSERVER/INBOX for an IMAP account
	# or imaps:// for an IMAPS account, as well.
	ssoma add $LISTNAME $URL maildir:/path/to/maildir

	# read with your favorite MUA (only using mutt as an example)
	mutt -f /path/to/maildir # (or /path/to/mbox)

	# to keep your mbox or maildir up-to-date, periodically run the following:
	ssoma sync $LISTNAME

	# your MUA may modify and delete messages from the maildir or mbox,
	# this does not affect ssoma functionality at all

	# to sync all your ssoma subscriptions
	ssoma sync

	# You may wish to sync in your cronjob
	ssoma sync --cron
