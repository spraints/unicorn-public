client_body_buffer_size in unicorn is only for request bodies (uploads),
and not relevant to header sizes.

I suspect you're hitting the nginx large_client_header_buffers default
limit of 8K:

  http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#large_client_header_buffers

I checked the unicorn source, and ext/unicorn_http/global_variables.h
defines the maximum field value as 80K, 10 times more than what you're
seeing:

	DEF_MAX_LENGTH(FIELD_VALUE, 80 * 1024);

This value was inherited from Mongrel many years ago and never changed.

I just tried your script with the following config.ru to hit unicorn
directly (no nginx), and I got the expected lobster response.

$ unicorn -E none config.ru
----------- config.ru -----------
require 'rack/lobster'
use Rack::ContentLength
run Rack::Lobster.new
