It feels like we were getting some momentum here on an important but
long-dormant issue here... maybe it's time to move this discussion
to rack-devel? Perhaps there's another Rack luminary who can lead
the charge, or at least see if there's some consensus after a few
more years of shared experience on what "sane" encodings might
look like.

A lightweight way to move the implementation forward might be a
simple Rack middleware gem which sets the new encodings on the 
environment, or adding the functionality to rack itself. Once
developers were comfortable with the new regime, the app servers
could follow suit and put those encodings in the env natively,
and the Rubyland implementation of the new encodings could be
dropped.
