Hi Sam,

I just wanted to point out that the specification was meant to be =
optional and this is why it includes the `env['upgrade.websocket?']` =
flag to indicate support.=20

I don't think every server has to support Websockets - different server =
architectures favor different tasks and performance isn't a one size fit =
all.

However, it's high time (if not a bit late) Ruby had better support for =
applications that decide to use Websockets - which is, obviously, not =
all of them (I doubt that many applications need them).

I think it's wrong that Websockets are so complicated to implement in =
Ruby and Rack. The technology might be dangerous, but it does have it's =
uses (such as large file uploads, inter-app micro-services, game =
servers... to name just a few use-cases that survive HTTP/2).

- Bo.
