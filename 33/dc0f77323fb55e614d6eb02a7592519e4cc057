Thanks for confirming this fix!

Fwiw, the Ruby core team probably uses/tests on GNU/Linux more than any
other platform.  Bugs on less common development platforms (especially
w.r.t tricky thread/fork/signal handling issues) may go unnoticed
elsewhere.  If you're focused on using Ruby + *BSD in a production
system, I suggest testing/fixing/reporting issues against the Ruby
development branches as much as possible before they hit production :)
