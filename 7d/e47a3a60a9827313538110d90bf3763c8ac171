Hello Eric,

Sorry, switched to plain text now...

So the idea is that nginx will buffer the upload request until all
data is received and then it will send it to unicorn? So unicorn only
receives the full request? Should I do some configuration to nginx for
this?

In fact, we are still using apache, but are planing to switch to nginx soon=
...

regards,
br=C3=A1ulio
