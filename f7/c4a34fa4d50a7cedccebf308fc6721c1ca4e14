I didn't think of it until now, but I don't think it's necessary to
expose.  With the exception of creating Unix domain sockets, unicorn
always respects the umask given to it, and unicorn only changes
permissions inside worker processes.

Also, nginx (where unicorn draws many design elements from) does not
change the permissions of the pid file, either.

Yeah, there's no point in knowing it unless you can send signals to it.
