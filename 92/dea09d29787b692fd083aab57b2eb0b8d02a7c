Are you having problems at 50 req/s or higher than that with ab?

Is ab hitting nginx or unicorn?  You'll probably get more
accurate/consistent results using ab with keepalive (-k) and hitting
nginx with ab.

Fwiw, I don't (and don't intend to) monitor external websites for
questions, especially when they require signups.  Feel free to post
my response in part or full (or link back to this ML archive).

I'll quote the relevant parts

<snip> nginx config looks fine.

The Unicorn config would be helpful here, too.

Can you try setting the listen:backlog directive to a higher number?
Something like:

  listen "/tmp/app.sock", :backlog => 8192

You'll want to stay within your net.core.somaxconn = 8192 value or raise
that sysctl to match unicorn.  However, if you have multiple machines
and want to load balance, I recommend trying a lower backlog.

Can you also verify unicorn is correctly closing connections that nginx
opens to it?  unicorn 4.3.1 should be fine in this regard...

I haven't tested with nginx 1.2.x, yet, but I expect it to be fine.
I know 1.2.x also supports keepalive to backend connections, but
I don't expect it to benefit on a fast LAN or local Unix socket...

Thanks for reminding us to Cc: :)

I think Tom had a similar question a few years ago
http://mid.gmane.org/20090918064831.GA5285@dcvr.yhbt.net

However, hitting issues with the default backlog (1024) with 50 req/s
wouldn't be expected...
