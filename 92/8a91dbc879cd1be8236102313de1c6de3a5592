Thanks, which compiler and version did you use?

Yes, seems corect since the compiler doesn't need to keep
mark_ary anymore once it only needs the address (&mark_ary).
OBJ_FREEZE is an inline which does nothing to prevent
the compiler from only keeping RBasic->flags around and
not the actual VALUE.
