Assuming you are proxying via domain socket, raindrops includes a
parser to extract the socket's active and queued connections.  We use
a script that publishes the following to our monitoring tools:

    Raindrops::Linux.unix_listener_stats(["/path/to/socket"])[0]
    # => #<struct Raindrops::ListenStats active=6, queued=0>

If you want to call this repeatedly without a process supervisor, you
can use bash scripts embedded in cron to get arbitrary granularity:

    SHELL=bash
    * * * * * for ((n=0;n<12;n++)); do /bin/publish_stats; sleep 5; done
