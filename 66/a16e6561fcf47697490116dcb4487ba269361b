Subject: nakayoshi_fork for CoW memory use reductions

I thought I posted about when I first heard about it, but
apparently not.

It's a RubyGem which should help with CoW memory savings
for Ruby 2.2+ due to the introduction of generational GC.

	https://rubygems.org/gems/nakayoshi_fork
	git clone https://github.com/ko1/nakayoshi_fork.git

You can also get a similar effect calling GC.start(full_mark: false)
four times in the unicorn before_fork hook, but nakayoshi_fork
is a bit more sophisticated in that it stops looping when it knows
it can't proceed.

Anyways, I was reminded of this while responding to
	https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11101
which may affect some unicorn users, too.
