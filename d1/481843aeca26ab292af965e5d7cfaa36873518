I suggest adding better logging to your app, perhaps to log when
requests start.

And to use application-level timeouts, see:

The SIGKILL timeout in unicorn is only a last resort when the Ruby VM
is broken beyond repair and cannot respond to any signals[1].

[1] SIGKILL and SIGSTOP are special signals which the kernel
    enforces, Ruby has no chance to block/catch/ignore them.
