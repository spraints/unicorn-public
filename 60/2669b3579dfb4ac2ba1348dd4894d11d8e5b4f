The target audience is people deploying/maintaining/managing HTTP apps
that only clients within their LAN are expected/allowed to hit.  Of
course, with a decent reverse proxy in front, all traffic from the
reverse proxy can be considered internal and fast (unless your LAN is
horrible).

Clients don't have to be on a Unix-like OS, of course.

It's also a testing ground for features that may make it into Mongrel 2
(assuming portability requirements are met).  Unicorn gives us more
freedom to exploit features unique to Unix-like systems (and maybe even
(optionally) Linux 2.6+ in the future).

Fwiw, I've known about (and implemented similar (but meaner :)) things
like the recently-disclosed Slowloris for several years now.  That's why
we refuse to support Unicorn talking directly to the Internet at large.

There's also some philosophy and design notes here that describe why we
did some of the things we did:
