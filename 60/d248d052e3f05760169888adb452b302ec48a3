Hello all,

Currently, unicorn kills a worker that reached timeout with the
following message:
E, [2014-12-04T19:12:23.646053 #32612] ERROR -- : worker=3D4 PID:11911
timeout (61s > 60s), killing

How can I see which URL was being processed by that worker?

I need to identify the problematic request.

cheers,
br=C3=A1ulio
