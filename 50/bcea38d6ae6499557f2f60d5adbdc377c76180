Braulio,

Are you referring to the vertical grey line? That is the deployment event.
The part that spikes in the first graph is request queue which is a bit
different on newrelic:
http://blog.newrelic.com/2013/01/22/understanding-new-relic-queuing/

We are using HAProxy to load balance (round robin) to 4 physical hosts
running unicorn with 6 workers.

I have not tried to reproduce this on 1 master - I assume this would be the
same.

I do in fact do the sleep now:
https://gist.github.com/sarkis/1aa296044b1dfd3695ab#file-unicorn-rb-L37 -
the deployment results above had the 1 second sleep in there.
