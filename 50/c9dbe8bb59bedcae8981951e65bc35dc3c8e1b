mlmmj[1] needs to know YOUR email address when you email:

	unicorn-public+unsubscribe@bogomips.org

Do NOT use "unroll.me" or similar services.

They are meant for unsubscribing from marketing lists with unique
unsubscription addresses for each recipient.  That's not how
discussion list managers like mlmmj, ezmlm, or Mailman work.

Dealing with bounces and unsubscription is why I prefer people
read mailing lists over NNTP or HTTP:

nntp://news.public-inbox.org/inbox.comp.lang.ruby.unicorn
nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.unicorn.general
http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/

You'll never need a subscription or even a valid reply
address to mail this list.
