Hi Jamie, thanks for the follow up.

Exactly which version of Ruby + patchlevel are you using?   Some of the
1.8.7 releases had threading bugs in them which you may be hitting:

  http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/1993
  http://www.daniel-azuma.com/blog/view/z2ysbx0e4c3it9/ruby_1_8_7_io_select_threading_bug

But ...

Now that we know it's NewRelic, I suspect it could be reading from the
agent's client socket, not a log file.  You can map fd => files/sockets
with "ls -l /proc/$pid/fd" or "lsof -p $pid"

Perhaps in the before_fork hook you can try closing the TCPSocket (or
similar) that NewRelic is using.  Merely stopping the agent thread
isn't guaranteed to close the client socket properly (in fact, I can
almost guaratee it won't close the socket at the OS level).

Since you're on Linux, try putting the output of "ls -l /proc/#$$/fd" or
"lsof -p #$$" in both the after_fork+before_fork hooks to get an idea of
which descriptors are open across forks.

There's nothing inherent to Unicorn that prevents it from playing nicely
with threads.  It's just not playing nicely with threaded code written
without potential fork() calls in mind.
