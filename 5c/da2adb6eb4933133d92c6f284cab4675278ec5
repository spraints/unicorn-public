Yep, you can check for deliverability of any message by
checking: bogomips.org/unicorn-public/$MESSAGE_ID/
(or just look near the top of http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/)

Nothing hits the list until it hits the archives.

I also suggest always Bcc:-ing yourself instead of having your
mail client save to a "Sent" folder so you can:

a) test deliverability (including the Message-ID: in headers
   if it's added by the server and not your client)

b) get proper threading with any reply-to-all lists you're not
   subscribed to.

I'm not entirely sure why unicorn logs it, either.  I think it
was already expected in 2009 for application servers to log
that (thin/mongrel/...?)

Similarly, I don't like the "timeout" feature of unicorn
anymore, either since it encourages hiding bugs.

There's no chance of removing either feature, of course.
