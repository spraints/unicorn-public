I'm stumped :<

Do you have any background threads running that could be hanging the
workers?   This is Ruby 1.8, after all, so there's more likely to be
some blocking call hanging the entire process.  AFAIK, some monitoring
software runs a background thread in the unicorn worker and maybe the
OpenSSL extension doesn't work as well if it encountered network
problems under Ruby 1.8

Otherwise, I don't know...
