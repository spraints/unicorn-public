That was intentional, I think.  We should never be encouraging
users to pollute config.ru and make it difficult to migrate/test
other servers.

I really hate the -N vs RACK_ENV=none redundancy...  Is -N still
needed for Rails or something else while keeping RACK_ENV unset?

Worse case is we only support default_middleware as a config
option (but I prefer not to add more options).  Embedded -N support
is an anti-feature which leads to lock-in.

Thanks.
