I was afraid you'd say that :(.

We don't explicitly create any threads in our rails code.  We do communicate with backgroundrb worker processes, although, none of the strangeness today involved any routes that would hit backgroundrb workers.

Is there any instrumentation that I could add that might help debugging in the future? ($request_time and $upstream_response_time are now in my nginx logs.)  We have noticed these "unexplainable timeouts" before, but typically for a single worker.  If there's some debugging that could be added I might be able to track it down during these one-off events.

Thoughts?

I absolutely appreciate all your help!
