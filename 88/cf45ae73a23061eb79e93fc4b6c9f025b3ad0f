IMHO, you're holding your developers back and they'll constantly
be running into new problems in Ruby development.

WSL needs to add support for those Linux options if they intend
to pass themselves off as Linux-compatible.  And it seems you
guys pay for MS licenses, so they they should be fixing stuff
for you.

No flags or new options for this.  Ruby 2.3+ should be OK to run
entirely w/o kgio using the `exception: false` keyword.  I don't
know if you want to take a stab at it, there's not a whole lot
of kgio use in unicorn, even.

However, Ruby 2.0 and even 1.9.3 support should be maintained;
but maybe that can lazy-load kgio and fall back to expensive
exceptions if kgio isn't found.

There should be no increase in the bytecode or stack footprint
for 2.3+ users, but it's fine for users on older Rubies.

I also wouldn't worry about exception costs for exception paths
where kgio_trywrite tries to write something but gives up if it
doesn't work; but the accept_nonblock codepath is pretty critical
for being kept garbage-free.


Anyways, we will never advertise support for any proprietary
systems, if it works it's incidental.
