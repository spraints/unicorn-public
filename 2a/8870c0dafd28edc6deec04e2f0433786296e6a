Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.3.0.pre1 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and Unix

unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

This is a pre-release RubyGem intended for testing.

Changes:

unicorn 5.3.0.pre1

A largish release with several new features.

Simon Eskildsen contributed heavily using TCP_INFO under Linux
to implement the (now 5 year old) check_client_connection feature:

  https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-check_client_connection
  https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:check_client_connection&d:..20170324&x=t

This also led to FreeBSD and OpenBSD portability improvements in
one of our dependencies, raindrops:

  https://bogomips.org/raindrops-public/20170323024829.GA5190@dcvr/T/#u

Jeremy Evans contributed several new features.  First he
implemented after_worker_exit to aid debugging:

  https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-after_worker_exit
  https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:after_worker_exit&d:..20170324&x=t#t

And then security-related features to isolate workers.  Workers
may now chroot to drop access to the master filesystem, and the
new after_worker_ready configuration hook now exists to aid with
chroot support in workers:

  https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-after_worker_ready
  https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Worker.html#method-i-user
  https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:after_worker_ready&d:..20170324&x=t#t
  https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:chroot&d:..20170324&x=t#t

Additionally, workers may run in a completely different VM space
(nullifying preload_app and any CoW savings) with the new
worker_exec option:

  https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-worker_exec
  https://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/?q=s:worker_exec&d:..20170324&x=t#t

There are also several improvements to FreeBSD and OpenBSD
support with the addition of these features.
