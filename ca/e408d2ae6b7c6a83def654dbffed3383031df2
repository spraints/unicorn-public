Subject: [PATCH 2/3] gemspec: relax Ruby version requirement for old RubyGems
Date: Sun,  1 Nov 2015 08:37:46 +0000

List-Id: <unicorn-public@bogomips.org>

Older RubyGems (1.8.23.2 at least) does not seem to support
multiple version requirements for the Ruby version; so drop
the lower 1.9.3 requirement for now.
