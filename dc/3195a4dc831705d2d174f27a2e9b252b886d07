That `exit!' is only temporary during worker init on SIGQUIT.

:QUIT is retrapped and made graceful at the end of init_worker_process:

  https://yhbt.net/unicorn.git/tree/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb?h=v6.0.0#n694

t/t0020-at_exit-handler.sh should be testing SIGQUIT behavior

SIGTERM/SIGINT remain `exit!' since they're specified as immediate
(well, as soon as Ruby sig handlers fire)
