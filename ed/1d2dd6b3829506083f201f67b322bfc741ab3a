That does make sense - I was looking at another suggestion from a user here
(Braulio) of running a "warmup" using rack MockRequest:
https://gist.github.com/brauliobo/11298486#file-unicorn-conf-rb-L77

The only issue I am having with the above solution is it is happening in
the before_fork block - shouldn't I warmup the connection in after_fork? If
I follow the above gist properly it warms up the server with the old
activerecord base connection and then its turned off, then turned back on
in after_fork. I think I am not understanding the sequence of events
there... If this is the case, I should warmup and also check/kill the old
master in the after_fork block after the new db, redis, neo4j connections
are all created. Thoughts?
