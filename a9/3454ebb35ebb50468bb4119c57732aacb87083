General rule for me is to get the problem reproducible in the smallest
possible way.  That could mean removing features, cutting out large
chunks of code, cutting out certain request types, reducing
workers.

More things:

1) Can you make sure nginx is not trying to maintain persistent
  connections?  nginx should respect unicorn closing the connection
  but I haven't checked the latest versions of nginx.
  lsof can help here, too.

  unicorn currently does not do persistent connections, allowing
  an M:N relationship between nginx instances and unicorn
  instances[1]

2) Any other odd external dependencies such as NFS mounts,
   file locks, FIFOs, etc?


[1] Perhaps persistent connections will be an option in the future
    if the support/documentation overhead is worth it, as nginx
    supports persistent connections to backends nowadays.
