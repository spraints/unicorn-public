I don't know, either, and I'm not sure if anybody here wrote
those guides.  It really doesn't matter a whole lot.

I do prefer shorter pathnames with fewer path components, though;
it lets the kernel do fewer dcache lookups to get to the socket.
Not sure how much for nginx in your case, but relative vs absolute
pathnames certainly mattered for git back in the day:
