It's probably something related to your frontend/Angular setup (which I
know nothing about).  Try disabling cookies + cache in your browser
completely...  Some browsers have extensions/plugins which can trace
HTTP requests, too.

Server debugging:

Uncomment one of your "error_log" lines in your nginx conf:

	error_log logs/error.log debug;

	(you can change the path, of course)

I suggest using your Ubuntu (or any GNU/Linux) test environment which
has strace.  I cannot support any software on Darwin.

You may also use tcpdump/strace on your browser, too, but I suspect for
your case it'll be easier to use whatever debugging tools +
plugins/extensions your browser supports.

This really doesn't seem to be a unicorn or nginx bug, though...
