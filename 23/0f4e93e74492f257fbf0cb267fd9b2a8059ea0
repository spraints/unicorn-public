Thanks for taking a look.

I'd rather have some wiggle room in case problems are found on
either side; so people can rollback one without affecting the
other(*).

It also relaxes things for distro packagers for coordinating
releases; in case there's other dependencies (whether human or
technical) which slow down the process.


(*) We may drop raindrops as a hard requirement for unicorn at
    some point, too.  The intended use case for counter sharing
    across hundredes/thousands of workers on massively multicore
    CPUs never surfaced.
