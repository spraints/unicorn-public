Subject: Request Queueing after deploy + USR2 restart

We have a rails application with the following unicorn.rb:
http://goo.gl/qZ5NLn

When we deploy to the application, a USR2 signal is sent to the unicorn
master which spins up a new master and we use the before_fork in the
unicorn.rb config above to send signals to the old master as the new
workers come online.

I've been trying to debug a weird issue that manifests as "Request
Queueing" in our Newrelic APM. The graph shows what happens after a
deployment (represented by the vertical lines). Here is the graph:
http://goo.gl/iFZPMv . As you see from the graph, it is inconsistent -
there is always a latency spike - however, at times Request Queueing is
higher than previous deploys.

Any ideas on what exactly is going on here? Any suggestions on
tools/profilers to use to get to the bottom of this? Should we expect this
to happen on each deploy?

Thanks,
