Yes, that sucks.  I'll often just throw some requests at the child
just to start something up if I need it, or initiate a separate daemon.

No, unfortunately not.  I have considered petitioning for something
along the lines of pthread_atfork() in Ruby, but pthread_atfork() itself
also has unfortunate drawbacks (it makes fork() async-signal un-safe,
and thus _Fork() will be introduced in the next version of POSIX).
