Are your users remote? (outside of your immediate LAN).

The upload speed (and thus timeout) for unicorn should be based on
the nginx <-> unicorn transfer rate.  Unicorn should never talk to users
directly and users can upload slowly to nginx which buffers requests to the
filesystem, first.

I have a LAN-only application that regularly processes uploads several
hundreds of megabytes (via PUT) directly to Unicorn.  The local disk I/O
is often the limiting factor since the parallel requests fill up the
kernel buffers and wait on disk I/O.  The Rack application itself
unfortunately needs to seek/rewind so it must be in the filesystem.

Rainbows! with ThreadSpawn/ThreadPool can process uploads without
buffering them to disk first (but the Rack multipart parser may not).
I often stream several hundred megabytes of data directly to apps on
Rainbows! via PUT requests (curl -T), too.
