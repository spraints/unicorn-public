In short: upgrade to Rails 2.3.4 (or later)

Note: the workaround described in the article above only made
the issue more subtle and we didn't notice them immediately.

+* Rails 2.3.2 bundles its own version of Rack.  This may cause subtle
+  bugs when simultaneously loaded with the system-wide Rack Rubygem
+  which Unicorn depends on.  Upgrading to Rails 2.3.4 (or later) is
+  strongly recommended for all Rails 2.3.x users for this (and security
+  reasons).  Rails 2.2.x series (or before) did not bundle Rack and are
+  should be unnaffected.  If there is any reason which forces your
+  application to use Rails 2.3.2 and you have no other choice, then
+  you may edit your Unicorn gemspec and remove the Rack dependency.
