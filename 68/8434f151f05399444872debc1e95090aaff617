Strange, it works for me...

It's really awesome! I've tested it and it works great, and avoids the =

sleeping stuff and a new commandlline option. Congratulations :)

However there is still a not solved case. Let me please explain it with two =

examples:

1) In "after_fork" I set:
     worker.user("non_existing_user","non_existing_group")

The master process would start properly and would notify "success" to =

grandparent. (so the init script returns 0). But the fact is that all the =

workers fail to start and are respawned again and again.


2) I use "Clogger" in my Rack config.ru. But I set a log file in a path tha=
t =

doesn't exist. Clogger raises due to this (it doesn't try to create the ful=
l =

path).
Again the master process has notified "success" to grandparent (exis status=
 0 =

then) but the workers are respawned again and again.


In both cases, if "preload_app" is false then doing a "ps" I see new master =

processes being created by first master process (with new workers) and all =
of =

them die while new ones born.
If "preload_app" is false then there are no borning master processes as jus=
t =

the workers fail to start when loading the Rack app.


It would be great if the same mechanims (master notifies to grandparent) wo=
uld =

be implemented between first process loading the Rack app (a worker if =

"preload_app") and master process, so if the first worker fails when loadin=
g =

the Rack app then master process doesn't notify "success" to grandparent an=
d =

exists (instead of respawning again and again the workers).

If "preload_app" is true then I don't understand why your new code doesn't =

work right now. I expect that master process notifies "success" to grandpar=
ent =

before loading the Rack app, am I right? would make sense master process to =

wait until Rack app is loaded and if it fails then notify "error" and exit =

completely?


Kind regards and thanks a lot for your great work.
