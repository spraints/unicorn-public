Sure, replies in line...

Did any connections ever work?

OK, so that means it's listening to all IP addresses on TCP port 8080;
no problem here.

If you use curl to hit 8080 on the host(s) unicorn is running,
it should work.

Off-topic, GC.copy_on_write_friendly is the default in Ruby 2.0+;
(and IIRC it wasn't in any official Ruby release, just the
Phusion "Enterprise Edition")

Is "unicorn" an entry in your DNS (via search path) or
an entry in /etc/hosts file?

There's also no reference to port 8080 anywhere in your nginx
config, so I don't know how nginx is supposed to know that
unicorn is on port 8080.

I would expect to see something like:

    server unicorn.internal.example.com:8080;

Or if on the same host:

    server 127.0.0.1:8080;

No references to port 8080 in either location block, either.

I don't think you need 8080 in location block if you have them
in the "upstream backend" block; it's been a while since I've
used nginx... But you need 8080 (and the correct IP address or
DNS entry) somewhere.
