I'm not sure how Unicorn is actually replying to anything, does HAProxy
write *anything* to the socket?

Logging those bad connections is another DoS vector I'd rather avoid,
and for connections where nothing is written, not even possible...

If you have the TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT (Linux) or accept filters (FreeBSD),
it's highly likely the Unicorn would never see the connection if the
client never wrote to it.

HAProxy starts writing request bodies to Unicorn as soon as the upload
starts, which means the Unicorn process will be bounded by the speed of
the original client connection.  If multiple clients upload slowly,
then you'll end up hogging many Unicorn workers.

nginx can also limit the size of client uploads (default 1M) to prevent
unnecessary I/O.

If you serve large responses that can't fit in kernel socket buffers,
then Unicorn will get stuck writing out to a client that isn't reading
fast enough.

AFAIK, HAProxy also does not yet maintain keep-alive connections to
clients, whereas nginx does. Keep-alive is important to client browsers,
they can halve their active connections to a site if keep-alive is
supported.
