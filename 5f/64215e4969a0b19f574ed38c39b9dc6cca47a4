If you hit any errors or truncated/corrupted responses when reading ML
archives at http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/ it's probably because of
a bug in the new rack.hijack-based proxy in front of the prefork Apache2
instance hosting.

Drop me (or this list) a plain-text mail with the URL(s) and any info
about your client/connection that's broken for you

Previously, it was yahns using a synchronous (Rack, no-hijack) proxy
from yahns in the extras/proxy_pass.rb file[2]

before:
  yahns:extras/proxy_pass.rb -> varnish -> mpm_prefork+mod_perl

after:
  yahns:lib/yahns/proxy_pass.rb -> varnish -> mpm_prefork+mod_perl

yahns mailing list archives with all the relevant commits are here:
http://yhbt.net/yahns-public/

In case the HTTP portion of the archives get hosed, archives of the
mailing lists are still git clonable with ssoma[1] (or just using
"git clone")

	git://yhbt.net/yahns-public
	git://bogomips.org/unicorn-public

In case the server is gets completely hosed by the yahns proxy_pass
changes, archives are still readable at:

	https://www.mail-archive.com/yahns-public@yhbt.net/
	https://www.mail-archive.com/unicorn-public@bogomips.org/

Finally, in case you haven't realized by now; unicorn has always been a
rip-off of Apache(1|2) prefork design.  The major difference is the
marketing of unicorn always focused on the shortcomings of the design :>

So any fully-buffering reverse proxy such as nginx or yahns/proxy_pass
which protects one preforking server implementation from slow clients
will protect another...
