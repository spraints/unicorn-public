We have discovered that every time a unicorn worker is restarted, rails =
throws "PG::ConnectionBad: connection is closed=E2=80=9D errors.

We are using preload: true, and have before and after fork rules to =
close and reopen the connections:

---------------------------------------------------
before_fork do |server, worker|
 defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and
     ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!

   old_pid =3D "#{server.config[:pid]}.oldbin"
   if File.exist?(old_pid) && server.pid !=3D old_pid
     begin
       sig =3D (worker.nr + 1) >=3D server.worker_processes ? :QUIT : =
:TTOU
       Process.kill(sig, File.read(old_pid).to_i)
     rescue Errno::ENOENT, Errno::ESRCH
       # someone else did our job for us
     end
   end
end

after_fork do |_server, _worker|
  defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and =
ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection

  child_pid =3D _server.config[:pid].sub('.pid', ".#{_worker.nr}.pid")
  system("echo #{Process.pid} > #{child_pid}")
end
---------------------------------------------------

Yet it seems that something is holding onto a dead connection and trying =
to use it.=20

We have definitely correlated it to worker restarts - we have a monit =
process in place to restart individual workers if they exceeded a memory =
threshold, and when this number was too low, they were getting recycled =
often and we saw a very high number of these errors. When we raised the =
threshold, the error almost completely disappeared (but it still happens =
sometimes when a worker is recycled).

How can we troubleshoot this?

Thanks!
