I read and stash the value of the pid file before issuing any USR2.
Later, you can issue "kill -0 $old_pid" after sending SIGQUIT
to ensure it's dead.

Checking the mtime of the pidfile is really bizarre...

OTOH, there's times when users accidentally remove a pid
file and regenerate by hand it from ps(1), too...
