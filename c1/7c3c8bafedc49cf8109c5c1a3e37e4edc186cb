Sorry for my late rely.

I haven't tried it yet. Currently, we are using RVM to install ruby, but
as soon as I've some time, I'll setup a source version of ruby and apply
some of these patches.

Yeah - I've also ask a college to test it under FreeBSD (without Jail) and
he can't reproduce it either. It seems to be a Jail problem (I would run
in cycles too, if I would be in Jail ;-).

Yes - I'm pretty sure that SMP is involved.

Kind regards
