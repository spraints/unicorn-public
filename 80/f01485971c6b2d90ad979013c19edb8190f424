I am a huge fan of GitHub and use it daily in my professional job, but both
the original message and now this comes off full of youthful arrogance and
hubris (in addition to abysmal grammar). GitHub is not the only way to do
open-source, and developers who refuse to use something other than GitHub
tend to be people impressed by superficial polish, but lacking
understanding in the type of deep engineering that allows for things like
the Linux kernel (or preforking app servers like Unicorn) to work.  There
is more to software engineering than what is fashionable in the last 5
years.  Please be more respectful of the maintainers of serious software
like Unicorn than to piss on their choice of project management tools and
techniques.
