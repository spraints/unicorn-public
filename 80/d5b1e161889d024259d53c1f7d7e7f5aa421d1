I use RACK_ENV to configure the environment for my web applications, and
for a few reasons have used development/test/production as the
environment names.  I try as much as possible to have the development
environment mirror the production environment unless there is a good
reason to be different, and would like to avoid adding all of the
middleware Unicorn adds in development mode.

Additionally, let's say I want to add Rack::CommonLogger to both
development and production environments.  So in my config.ru, I add:

  use Rack::CommonLogger, Logger.new($stderr)

Now I load up the development version.  Then I have two common loggers
in development, with all requests being logged twice.  I currently
work around this by doing something like:

  unless ENV['RACK_ENV'] == 'development'
    use Rack::CommonLogger, Logger.new($stderr)
  end

I would like to avoid having to do that.

I don't really care about embedded -N support.  I actually didn't even
know embedded command file options were possible until I saw the
comment in Unicorn.builder.  I just want some way to specify not to
load default middleware without requiring a command line option each
time.

Thanks,
Jeremy
