OK.  Does the other app connect to any other external services?
If you're not sure, you can check with: lsof -p $WORKER_PID

Do lsof once a worker has had a few requests served, as some libraries
lazily open connections.  I suggest debugging problems on an instance
with only one worker to make reproducing the problem easier.

There should be a general query timeout for all DB/external connections:
  http://unicorn.bogomips.org/Application_Timeouts.html

I haven't been able to reproduce the issue on a hello-world app with
no external dependencies:

$ unicorn -E none -c unicorn.conf.rb
---------- unicorn.conf.rb ----------
timeout 20
------------ config.ru --------------
require 'rack/lobster'
use Rack::ContentLength
run Rack::Lobster.new
--
