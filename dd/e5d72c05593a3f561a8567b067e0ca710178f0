Thanks for the quick reply. I very much appreciate the insight.

Just to make sure I understand this correctly though, in order for the me=
trics to be available between workers, the raindrops structs would need t=
o be setup for each metric before unicorn forks=3F=C2=A0

Are you suggesting this data store would be shared between workers or one=
 per worker (and whatever displays the metrics would read all the stores)=
=3F I tried sharing between workers with DBM and GDBM and both of them en=
d up losing metrics due to being overwritten by other threads. I imagine =
I would have to lock the file whenever one is writing, which would block =
other workers (not ideal). Out of the box PStore works fine for this (sur=
prisingly). I'm guessing it does file locks behind the scenes.

Right now I'm thinking that the best way to handle this would be one data=
 store per worker and then whatever reads the metrics scrapes them all re=
ad-only. My biggest concern with this approach is knowing which data-stor=
es are valid. I suppose I could put them all in a folder based off the pa=
rent's pid. However, would it be possible that some could be orphaned if =
a worker is killed by the master=3F I would need some way for the master =
to communicate to the collector (probably in a worker) what other workers=
 are actively running. Is that possible=3F
