Hi Eric,

Thanks very much for looking over my patch.

I've taken a look at yahns and the changes you made there, and I've
also been testing Unicorn here with my patch. I'm a bit confused about
your comments regarding the problems with forking and
minitest/autorun, because I'm not personally seeing test failures
regarding forking and my patch.

I am seeing one failure with the final assert in
TestSocketHelper#test_bind_listen_unix_rebind, but I don't think
that's a result of this, right?

Would you mind pointing me in the right direction?

- Ken
