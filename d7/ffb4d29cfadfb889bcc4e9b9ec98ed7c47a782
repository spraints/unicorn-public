Hello,

Okay, my apologies, I misunderstood the signal handling code.  I
thought you were doing something like
self_writer.write_nonblock(signal) instead.  This is what I thought of
initially because I was still thinking in the context of C (where
signals are not deferred and allocating new space on a queue in a
signal handler would be unsafe) instead of in the context of Ruby
where Ruby's signals are deferred.  Incidentally, MRI's signal handler
implementation in signal.c appears to be broken in several ways but
that is a separate topic for a separate place.

Thank you,
Steven Stewart-Gallus
