This is may be a bug in a C extension RubyGem or even Ruby itself.
Do you get core dumps + backtraces or any other error messages in the logs?
Which OS/distribution is this?

Since you see SIGABRT/SIGIOT and not SIGSEGV, you might be crashing
inside the SIGSEGV handler of Ruby itself.

Can you also try --enable-debug-env when you ./configure Ruby?
Thanks in advance for any more info you can provide!

(Btw, please keep everybody Cc:-ed since the mailing list is going
 in that direction, and rubyforge.org isn't very reliable in its
 final days.  New ML announcement in a few days).
