Patch coming soon, already pinpointed it, just wanted to look at the
issues to see if someone already solved it when I noticed that it's

But yeah otherwise, use whatever you like, chances are you do the most

As far as I am concerned any other OS/self-hosted tool like gitlab etc
would also be an improvement.
