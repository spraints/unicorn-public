Maybe in a few months or half a year ...

I've still got a lot of legacy crap on Ruby 2.7.x and Rack 1.x;
but buried with high priority obligations and absolutely not willing
to deal with MFA, corporate policies, proprietary software,
JavaScript, graphics, HTML mail, marketing, etc. nor do I wish to
deal with anybody who expects me to deal with that crap.

I also using ancient hardware to ensure accessibility, so things
move a bit more slowly...
