Hello, =

 	I am not usually a ruby developer, and I just recently stumbled across
an odd bug, that only someone who  didn=B9t know what they were doing would
stumble across.  I am honestly not sure if this really counts as a bug,
but I thought I should let you know.

unicorn/lib/unicorn.rb line 62 is:

      pp({ :inner_app =3D> inner_app }) if $DEBUG

Nowhere in the file is there require =8Cpp=B9

This is not an issue if you run "unicorn -d config.ru=B2, but If you
manually set $DEBUG =3D true,  which I foolishly did because I didn=B9t
realize that $DEBUG was a special variable in ruby,  you get an undefined
method error.   =



I will be changing my code to use a different variable name, however I am
not sure if there are valid reasons to manually set $DEBUG in ruby.  If
there are, this may be an issue for others.

I think the simplest solution would be to replace the line above with an
if block:

      if $DEBUG
        require 'pp'
        pp({ :inner_app =3D> inner_app })
      end


Similar blocks appear in unicorn/bin/unicorn and
unicorn/bin/unicorn_rails. I am assuming the one in unicorn/bin/unicorn
is the one that allows it to work when using the -d flag. If there really
is never any reason to manually set $DEBUG I=B9m sorry I wasted your time.

In any case, thank you for Unicorn!

Jim Robinson
