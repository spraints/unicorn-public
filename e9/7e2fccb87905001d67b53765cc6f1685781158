You can definitely set the pid in the config file, let me know
if you're having issues...

It's only ignored at that time, the pid is dropped later in the start
method:

http://git.bogomips.org/cgit/unicorn.git/tree/lib/unicorn.rb#n114

	self.pid =3D config[:pid]

So I don't drop the pid file until listeners are bound.  I can't
remember why I drop the pid late, however :)

I know I don't bind the listeners right away because I try inheriting
them first.  It might be to avoid issues with the pid clobbering in the
parent, or that some health checkers rely on both the pid and listen
socket or something...

The config file really should work, but be sure to let me know if it's
still not working for you.  I just tested unicorn_rails with a test app
and it seems to work here.  Perhaps you're hitting permissions problems?

As far as permissions, I'm considering adding user switching, but I'm
afraid it could lead to more problems/support issues since I don't know
anybody who runs Mongrel/Thin as root.  However I've already
written a huge comment/example in the Configurator RDoc for it :)

Cool, thanks for the feedback.

I've had lots of issues dealing with ugly/limited config files and seen
too many ways of templating them to count.  The after_fork, before_fork,
and before_exec hooks sealed the deal for Ruby and Ezra / Rack::Builder
helped push me in the right direction with the DSL.  It was originally
"write a small ruby script to run this thing" :)
