Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.5.0.pre1 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and Unix
Message-ID: <20181220222842.GA27382@dcvr>

unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Disclaimer:

Due to its ability to tolerate crashes and isolate clients, unicorn
is unfortunately known to prolong the existence of bugs in applications
and libraries which run on top of it.
