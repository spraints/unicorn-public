Hey guys,


i recently updated several components of my website setup: =


varnish   2.0.5 -> 2.0.6
nginx      7.4.2 -> 7.4.5
unicorn  0.95.3 -> 0.96
ruby18  to the latest patch level =

and rails from 2.3.2

It all seemed to work great but recently I noticed that the website hangs l=
oading. The weird thing is that it hangs because 2 or 3 javascript files ta=
ke about a minute to finish and when they do they are incomplete as in cut =
of in the middle of the content. The nginx error log gives the following ou=
tput every few seconds:

2010/02/04 08:58:41 [error] 29389#0: *471 upstream timed out (60: Operation=
 timed out) while reading upstream, client: 213.73.89.122, server: www.ccc.=
de, request: "GET /javascripts/jquery-1.3.2.min.js?1246657683 HTTP/1.1", up=
stream: "http://unix:/var/run/unicorn.sock:/javascripts/jquery-1.3.2.min.js=
?1246657683", host: "www.ccc.de"

I don't think its varnishs fault because i get Internal Server Errors (500)=
 if I run curl on the machine against nginx, not at first though - several =
requests for that jquery file run just fine and then suddenly i get a 500 o=
n a request with the content being cut of in the middle.

Next thing I did was configuring unicorn to listen on 213.73.89.122:9090 ra=
ther than on a socket so i could run curl directly against it and even afte=
r a fresh start of unicorn gives me:


curl http://213.73.89.122:9090/javascripts/jquery-1.3.2.min.js
(lots of javascript)=85,rowspan:"rowSpan",tabindex:"tabIndHTTP/1.1 500 Inte=
rnal Server Error

curl: (18) transfer closed with 16256 bytes remaining to read

I also downgraded back to 0.95.3 but that didn't change anything. So now af=
ter 8h of try and error I'm out of ideas and would be happy to hear some su=
ggestions.

Kind regards, John
