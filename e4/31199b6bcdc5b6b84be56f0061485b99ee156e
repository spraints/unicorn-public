You are receiving this email because you were subscribed to the
soon-to-be-defunct mongrel-unicorn@rubyforge.org mailing list.

If you were filtering this list before, you'll have to update your
filters to match the following header:

	List-Id: <unicorn-public@bogomips.org>

You may unsubscribe by sending a blank email to:

	unicorn-public+unsubscribe@bogomips.org

Subscription is optional to encourage drive-by contributors.
Please Cc: everybody on replies, as not everybody is subscribed.
As usual, do not send HTML email.

Alternative reading options:

Atom feed: http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/atom.xml
HTML: http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/

Or subscribe to the ssoma[1] git repository at:
	git://bogomips.org/unicorn-public.git

The gmane news group may continue working, and I'll probably provide an
NNTP reading option for public-inbox in the future.

Thanks for reading!
