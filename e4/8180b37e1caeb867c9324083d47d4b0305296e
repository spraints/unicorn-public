During heavy traffic, yes, there's a chance due to the optimization
in worker_loop (lib/unicorn/http_server.rb):

      # make the following bet: if we accepted clients this round,
      # we're probably reasonably busy, so avoid calling select()
      # and do a speculative non-blocking accept() on ready listeners
      # before we sleep again in select().
      unless nr == 0
        tmp = ready.dup
        redo
      end

Note, "receives" requests isn't correct, workers "pull" requests from
a central queue in the kernel.
