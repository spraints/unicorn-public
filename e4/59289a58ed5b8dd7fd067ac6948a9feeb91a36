Ok, I should explain better why I need this feature:

I'm not coding a HTTP app on top of Unicorn to host in a server. Instead I'=
m =

building a XCAP server (RFC 4825) using Rack and Unicorn. I'll also publish=
 a =

Ruby gem containing all the server (Unicorn + Rack application).

So, any user could install the gem, set the database(s), fill the =

configuration file and star the server in background by running the provide=
d =

init script ("/etc/init.d/xcapserver start") which runs the server daemoniz=
ed.

Imagine that the user wrote a typo, i.e:

  after_fork do |server, worker|
    # Note the space typo:
    worker.u ser("www-data", "www-data") if Process.euid =3D=3D 0
  end

Then the init script would return 0 (success) but the server wouldn't work. =

The user would check "ps aux | grep xcapserver" and would see the xcapserve=
r =

running. It would be complex to understand why the server it's failing.

So it would be great the following:

- The user start the init script (which calls "unicorn -D ...") with a =

hypotethical new option ("--no-error-time 2").

- The command "unicorn -D" remains in foreground for 2 seconds before maste=
r =

process going to background.

- Unicorn fails to create the workers at the moment (so within 2 seconds).

- Instead of re-spawning them, the command (still in foreground) exits with =

return code 1 (error).




But there is other case which is much wrose IMHO. Imagine the user writes a =

space typo:

    stde rr_path "/var/log/xcapserver.err.log"

or imagine it uses a path that doesn't exist (/var/log/xcapserver/ doesn't =

exist):

    stderr_path "/var/log/xcapserver/err.log"

In both cases "unicorn -D" returns 0 but the server is not running (no unic=
orn =

process running). So, why did it return 0? It's not an error when creating =
the =

workers, but when running also the master process. IMHO in this case Unicor=
n =

should return non zero (even if it called with "-D").


I'm playing right now with unicorn/launcher.rb (daemonize! method)but I get =

nothing. Unfortunatelly I think that the usage of fork makes very difficult =

the main command to behave as I desire (exit status).

If you could give me some tips I'd try to implement it.

Reall thanks a lot again and again :)
