Hi John-Paul,

Reread my post carefully, not much is changing for 8-16 core users.
FreeBSD and SMP will continue to be supported.  I wasn't referring
to SMP at all when I was talking about Linux-only bits.

Thanks for the offer.  I'll keep it in mind if I need it again.

I know, I've fixed some things on OSX platforms via FreeBSD (OSX scares
me with its GUI-ness).  Keep in mind kqueue (and epoll) are worthless
for Unicorn itself since Unicorn only handles one client at a time.

However, Rainbows! can already use kqueue/epoll with EventMachine and
Rev.

Again, I wasn't talking about SMP at all.   SMP works fine on current
Unicorn and mid-sized servers.  When going to more cores, SMP itself
is a bottleneck, not the kernel.

With Unicorn 2.x, I'm targeting NUMA hardware that isn't available in
commodity servers yet.  Currently, NUMA makes _zero_ sense in web
application servers, but in case things change in a few years, we'll be
ready.

It may be a chicken-and-egg problem, too.  Hardware manufacturers are
slow to commoditize NUMA because a good chunk of software can't even
utilize SMP effectively :)

Again, don't worry :)  You'll be able to continue using everything
as-is.

> Kindest regards and thanks for all you efforts,

No problem.  Please don't top post in the future.
