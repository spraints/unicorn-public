Sure, rack-devel is a pretty dormant mailing list but there's been a
burst of activity a few weeks ago.

Unlike this list, subscription is required to post; and first posts
from newbies are moderated.  For folks who do not login to Google
(crazies like me :P) subscription is possible without any login
or password: rack-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com

At least there's other server implementers who'll probably
chime in.

Sounds like a good plan.  Thanks for bringing more attention to this.
