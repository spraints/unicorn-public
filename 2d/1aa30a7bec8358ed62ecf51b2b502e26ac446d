When I upload large files to my unicorn process, TeeInput is streaming them=
 through a @tmp instance variable which writes to /tmp/0.123456789 (some ra=
ndom number).  The file is immediately deleted but the file handle is not c=
losed, so the files are not really deleted by the file system.

The files are eventually deleted when GC runs, but before GC runs they cont=
inue to take up space.  You can see this in lsof output, for example:

ruby       2783   webuser  23u      REG               0,17  6128086    3556=
917 /tmp/0.04249158625633187 (deleted)

This can cause problems if you have big files and a small /tmp, such as a t=
mpfs disk mounted in ram.  If someone sends in several 100MB files, you cou=
ld easily get 2-3 open files for each of 6 unicorn processes, which would t=
ake up 1200MB of disk space until GC decides to run.

I looked into fixing this but it doesn't look easy.  I can reach into the T=
eeInput variable and close out the @tmp instance variable in my application=
, and that does fix the problem.  But obviously that is not a good solution=
.  I think there would have to be some kind of "close" method on http_reque=
st that would close out all the open resources such as these files.
