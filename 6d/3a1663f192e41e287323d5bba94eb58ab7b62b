Thanks for the note.  Something to that effect should be in the
commit message body.

I do: Ruby does not have a good track record when it comes to
maintaining backwards compatibility.  I no longer start new
projects in Ruby as a result.

If 3.0 seems OK (we won't be certain until December), then
bumping it to "< 4.0" should be acceptable for now.

Hint: you can make maintainers' life slightly easier by adding
a "--8<--\n" line before the patch, so "git am --scissors" works :>
(the "From " line is also unnecessary)

As noted above, something along the lines of ruby.git being on
3.0 and our current code being compatible with it is necessary,
here.

I prefer we keep that above comment, too, to keep working with
older rubygems.  Thanks.
