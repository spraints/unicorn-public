Hey, 

your plans sound great except for ignoring FreeBSD ;)

Seriously many many Servers, including many which I administrate run on FreeBSD and they do so very well. I'm not very familiar with the internals of the FreeBSD Kernel but I can assure you that it runs perfectly on 8 and 16 core machines and I would extremely happy if I could continue to use unicorn on them.

It should be easier to maintain a FreeBSD version as they (FreeBSD developers) tend to aim for more consistency across releases than Linux. You said once that you don't run any BSD machines but I'd be happy to offer you access to one of my BSD servers for testing.

Furthermore since Mac OS X and FreeBSD share many features like kqueue and many Ruby developers are running macs it would make even more sense to at least care about BSD even if its not you primary platform. 

I don't want to start a flame war or say that one OS is better than another. Linux is certainly great but so is FreeBSD. For the SMP part I recommend the following page on freebsd.org:

http://www.freebsd.org/smp/

And maybe specifically:

http://www.freebsd.org/smp/#resources

To conclude I can only say that I'm running unicorn on several FreeBSD hosts and so far I couldn't be happier with it. As stated before, I'd be more than happy to continue using that setup.

Kindest regards and thanks for all you efforts,

John
