Thanks for the confirmation, pushed as the following commit:

commit a6077391bb62d0b13016084b0eea36b987afe8f0
Author: Eric Wong <e@80x24.org>

    process SIGWINCH unless stdin is a TTY
    
    Some process managers such as foreman and daemontools rely on
    unicorn not daemonizing, but we still want to be able to process
    SIGWINCH in that case.
    
    stdout and stderr may be redirected to a pipe (for cronolog or
    similar process), so those are less likely to be attached to a TTY
    than stdin.  This also allows users to process SIGWINCH when running
    inside a regular terminal if they redirect stdin to /dev/null.
