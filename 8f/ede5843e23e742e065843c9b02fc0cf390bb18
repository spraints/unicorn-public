That coderack link no longer works for me, but I see no reason why
Rack::ProcTitle in rack-contrib wouldn't work (based on my reading of
the code):

http://github.com/rack/rack-contrib/blob/master/lib/rack/contrib/proctitle.rb

I guess it holds onto $0 after the app is done dispatching...

Yes, the backlog interrogation code is in Raindrops is very
Linux-specific.  The shared memory counters should be reasonably
portable to modern POSIX-ish systems (using GCC).

I have no idea if similar backlog interrogation functionality exists in
other operating systems.  I only learned of the Linux functionality
shortly before writing Raindrops.

If somebody could provide working patches for similar functionality in
other OSes, I'd be more than happy to include them into Raindrops.
