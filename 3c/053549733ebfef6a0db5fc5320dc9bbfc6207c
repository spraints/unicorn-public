Subject: [PATCH] README: minor updates and additional disclaimer
Date: Wed, 19 Dec 2018 02:47:40 +0000

Nowadays, I mainly rely on systemd (and not USR2) for
zero-downtime upgrades.  Also, CoW-friendliness is standard
in mainline Ruby since 2.0.

There also needs to be a disclaimer to point out the unfortunate
side-effect of robustness for hosting buggy apps.
