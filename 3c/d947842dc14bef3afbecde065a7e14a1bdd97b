The environment is untouched by default.  I meant Unicorn can only see
$0 as 'unicorn' or 'unicorn_rails', and never 'home_run', so the
version changes can't be picked up.

Ah, I've mostly given up on IRC since I get distracted easily or
everybody pops in at different times and lack of threading makes it hard
to follow.  I much prefer the asynchronous nature of email along with
its ease of archival, search, and patch exchange.  For intense
emergencies where money is lost for every second something is awry, yes,
IRC is great, but I do Free Software development at a much more relaxed
pace :)
