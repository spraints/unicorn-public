I see. If I understood correctly this only happens in foreground mode, 
so something like that would help me to understand the sentence:

"...If your unicorn process is bound to an interactive terminal (running in the foreground), you can skip this step."

I'd provide one if I could figure out some good way to automate this. 
Currently I perform all steps manually in production for zero downtime 
and only manage the other environments with Capistrano, except when I 
have a programmed downtime window for production.

I believe it would help the documentation if you added a link to init.sh 
in the SIGNALS page:

http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/tree/examples/init.sh

Anyway, even that script won't take care of making sure that the reload 
action will rollback in case of an unsuccessful deploy.

I realize it's not easy to detect if the deploy was successful and that 
it's very application dependent, but some generic procedures would be 
helpful for a basic Rails application. Unfortunately I don't know what 
would be a good strategy, that's why I asked :P

Thank you for explaining the interactive terminal binding question :)

Best,
Rodrigo.
