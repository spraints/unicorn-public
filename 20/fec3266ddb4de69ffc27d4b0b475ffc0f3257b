It=E2=80=99s possible; I=E2=80=99m using eye =
(https://github.com/kostya/eye) as a process monitor. I=E2=80=99m not =
aware of it writing .pid files for processes that self-daemonize like =
Unicorn, though. And once one of my servers =E2=80=9Cgoes bad=E2=80=9D =
(i.e. Unicorn starts failing to restart in response to a USR2), it does =
so 100% consistently until I stop and restart Unicorn entirely. Based on =
that, I don=E2=80=99t believe it=E2=80=99s a race condition where my =
process monitor is slipping in a new unicorn.pid file some of the time.

As far as I can tell, I have some servers that have gotten themselves =
into this =E2=80=9CUSR2 restart fails=E2=80=9D state, while others are =
working just fine. In both cases, the Unicorn process tree (as show in =
htop) looks like this =E2=80=9Cat rest=E2=80=9D (i.e. no =
deployments/restarts in progress):

unicorn master
`- unicorn master
`- unicorn worker[2]
|  `- unicorn worker[2]
`- unicorn worker[1]
|  `- unicorn worker[1]
`- unicorn worker[0]
   `- unicorn worker[0]

At first glance I=E2=80=99d definitely say it appears that I have two =
masters running from the same config files. However, there=E2=80=99s =
only one unicorn.pid file of course (the root process in the tree =
above), and when I try to kill -TERM the master process that doesn=E2=80=99=
t have a .pid file, the entire process tree exits. Am I misinterpreting =
the process table? Is this process list actually normal?

Thus far I=E2=80=99ve been unable to find any difference in state =
between a properly-behaving server and a misbehaving server, apart from =
the behaviour of the Unicorn master when it receives a USR2.

No, didn=E2=80=99t see anything like that (and I was looking for it).

EXT4 / Ubuntu Server 12.04 LTS

Given my environment above, I should be OK, right?

This has been happening pretty frequently across multiple server =
instances, and again once it starts happening on an instance, it keeps =
happening 100% of the time (until I restart Unicorn completely). So =
it=E2=80=99s not a rare edge case.

If I simply delete this hunk, I=E2=80=99ll have old masters left running =
on my servers because they=E2=80=99ll never get sent the QUIT signal. I =
can definitely remove it temporarily (and kill the old master myself) =
while debugging, though.

I=E2=80=99d definitely like to get rid of the sleep, as my restarts =
definitely feel slow. I=E2=80=99m not clear on what a better approach =
would be, though.

Any better examples/docs you=E2=80=99d recommend I consult for guidance? =
Or is expecting to achieve a robust zero-downtime restart using =
before_fork/after_fork hooks unrealistic?
