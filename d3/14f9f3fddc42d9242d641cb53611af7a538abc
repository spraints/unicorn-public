I suspect that needs "logger()" around it, like so:

    logger(Logger.new($stderr).tap do |newlgr|
      newlgr.formatter = JsonLogFormatter.new
    end)

cf. https://yhbt.net/unicorn/Unicorn/Configurator.html#method-i-logger

I suspect one of those lines could be the result of
Rack::CommonLogger from RACK_ENV=deployment or similar
(which matched "rackup" defaults back in 2009).

Personally, I always used something non-standard like "RACK_ENV=none"
to disable all default Rack middleware (--no-default-middleware
exists nowadays, too).

I've never used the "logger" directive much myself; maybe others
here can chime in with experience using non-standard loggers.
