Hi Patrick,

You shouldn't even need the logger directive, it goes to stderr by
default so your console will still show it.

I generally avoid shell aliases for per-app/project things since I
split my work across different apps + terminals + machines.

If I'm (rarely) developing an app that _requires_ a persistently running
web server, I'd just run in the foreground and Ctrl-C/<uparrow+enter> to
use my shell history.

Normally I just write integration tests (sometimes starting unicorn (or
zbatery) + hitting it with curl, but often just mocking a Rack env).
Unlike most folks that develop apps that run over HTTP, I have a strong
aversion to web browsers.  I'd rather pipe curl output to "vim -" if I
have to look at any text output from the application.

You'll probably get different answers from other folks here :)

Nothing that I know of.  It's quite common for Rails apps to have a
config/ directory, so maybe the unicorn config file is suitable there...
