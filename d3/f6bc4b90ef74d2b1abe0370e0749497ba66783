Hello all,

A quick comparison the average GC time per request reported by Newrelic:

Ruby 2.1.5, Rails 3.2.21 and Unicorn: ~15ms
Ruby 2.1.5 (with gctools middleware), Rails 3.2.21 and Unicorn: ~4ms
Ruby 2.2.0, Rails 3.2.21 and Unicorn: ~8ms

We see that ruby 2.2.0 improved, but still an out-of-band is even better.

cheers,
br=C3=A1ulio
