Are you disconnecting from/reconnecting to your database and any cache
stores in the before and after_fork hooks? Sharing the socket across
workers can potentially cause issues like this.

I'm deploying using rubber (https://github.com/rubber/rubber), and the unicorn.rb config is basically the GitHub unicorn config (as detailed here: https://github.com/blog/517-unicorn).
> Everything works fine when I deploy, but after half a day - 1 day the server behaves irrationally. The server is an api server for a mobile application so I can easily see some variables that, on request, have a certain value, but if I do some checking with the rails console (on the production machine) I get  a different value (the correct one). This seams to me like a weird object caching situation. It all gets solved if I restart unicorn.
