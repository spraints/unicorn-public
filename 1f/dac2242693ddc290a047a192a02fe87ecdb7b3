Yeah, I see that frequently on top.

But if all workers are warming up at once, say 10 workers, then the
old workers will slow down to serve requests, as CPU will be heavily used
by the warming up workers. That's is the main reason to slow down warm up.

Interesting... So the queue know about sleeping workers, but we have
to prevent that all workers are sleeping at the same time.

That's the ruby design, as the heap only grows, so with a request that
loads a lot of data the heap will grow big and never shrink.

Ruby 2.1 changes that? We will soon migrate to ruby 2.1, but we are
not ready for it yet.
