Subject: [PATCH] doc: document UNICORN_FD in manpage
Date: Thu, 12 Mar 2015 22:32:42 +0000
Message-Id: <1426199562-13009-1-git-send-email-e@80x24.org>
List-Id: <unicorn-public@bogomips.org>

Due to the prevalence of socket activation in modern init systems,
we shall document UNICORN_FD (previously an implementation detail)
in the manpage.

 Unicorn only uses (and will overwrite) the UNICORN_FD environment
 variable internally when doing transparent upgrades.
 
+UNICORN_FD is a comma-delimited list of one or more file descriptors
+used to implement USR2 upgrades.  Init systems may bind listen sockets
+itself and spawn unicorn with UNICORN_FD set to the file descriptor
+numbers of the listen socket(s).  The unicorn CONFIG_FILE must still
+have the inherited listen socket parameters defined as in a normal
+startup, otherwise the socket will be closed.
