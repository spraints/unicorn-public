Subject: Unicorn returns blank page after no use
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8; format=flowed
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit
List-Id: <unicorn-public@bogomips.org>

Hello,

I am not sure if this is the correct place for this, I have googled 
around to see if anyone else has encountered such an issue, but I did 
not find anything.

I am having this issue where after a period of time of no use (on beta 
[production] environment), maybe 12 hours or so, the unicorn process 
sleeps. When I go and re-request the page, it returns blank.

I am using Apache proxy to Unicorn.

My unicorn.stderr.log states:
I, [2015-07-01T03:07:05.168511 #13258]  INFO -- : master done reopening logs
I, [2015-07-01T03:07:05.232546 #16222]  INFO -- : worker=2 done 
reopening logs
I, [2015-07-01T03:07:05.239934 #13308]  INFO -- : worker=0 done 
reopening logs
I, [2015-07-01T03:07:05.307616 #13311]  INFO -- : worker=1 done 
reopening logs


When I request the page again, it loads fine. It is only during the 
process of "reopening logs" when it returns a blank page.

My unicorn.rb file:

worker_processes 3

# Load app into the master before forking workers
# for super-fast worker spawn times
preload_app true

# Listen on
listen "127.0.0.1:8550", :backlog => 1024

# Restart any workers that haven't responded in 180 seconds
timeout 600

# PID for the Unicorn master
pid "/var/www/r/shared/pids/unicorn.pid"

# Unicorn Log paths
stderr_path "/var/www/r/shared/log/unicorn.stderr.log"
stdout_path "/var/www/r/shared/log/unicorn.stdout.log"

before_fork do |server, worker|
   ##
   # When sent a USR2, Unicorn will suffix its pidfile with .oldbin and
   # immediately start loading up a new version of itself (loaded with a new
   # version of our app). When this new Unicorn is completely loaded
   # it will begin spawning workers. The first worker spawned will check to
   # see if an .oldbin pidfile exists. If so, this means we've just 
booted up
   # a new Unicorn and need to tell the old one that it can now die. To 
do so
   # we send it a QUIT.
   #
   # Using this method we get 0 downtime deploys.
   defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and 
ActiveRecord::Base.connection.disconnect!
   defined?(OathKeeper) and OathKeeper.disconnect!

   old_pid = '/var/www/r/shared/pids/unicorn.pid.oldbin'
   if File.exists?(old_pid) && server.pid != old_pid
     begin
       Process.kill("QUIT", File.read(old_pid).to_i)
     rescue Errno::ENOENT, Errno::ESRCH
       # someone else did our job for us
     end
   end
end

after_fork do |server, worker|
   ##
   #  # Unicorn master loads the app then forks off workers - because of 
the way
   #    # Unix forking works, we need to make sure we aren't using any 
of the parent's
   #      # sockets, e.g. db connection
   #
   defined?(ActiveRecord::Base) and ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection
   defined?(OathKeeper) and OathKeeper.reconnect
end

Any help would be appreciated!
Thank you!

Farjad
