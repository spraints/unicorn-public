That sucks.  Perhaps adding warnings about untested+unsupported
versions to test_helper.rb and extconf.rb is a better way to go?
(nothing annoying at runtime after it's installed, though)

Then, maybe leave the version check out of the gemspec entirely.

Fwiw, the type of breakage from incompatibilities I'm worried
about is subtle things that don't show up immediately
(e.g. encodings, hash ordering, frozen strings, etc...).

Stuff that obviously breaks at startup is preferable
(e.g. I added some 1.9 symbol hash keys to signal the move
away from 1.8).

Thanks.
