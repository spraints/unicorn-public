I use clogger (configurable logger) instead:
http://clogger.bogomips.org/

There's also unxf for that: http://bogomips.org/unxf/
but I don't use it as often.

There are probably others which are better, too...



Disclaimer: I absolutely detest using one project (unicorn, in
this case) to promote my other projects, here; so I'll say both
clogger and unxf are buggy as hell and will eat all your data
for lunch :>
