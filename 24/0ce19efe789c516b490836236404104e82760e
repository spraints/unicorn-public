Subject: dropping Ruby 1.8 support for unicorn 5?

We've brought this up a few times, but I suppose we might as well drop
1.8 support in a major version change.

We may still maintain unicorn 4.x for 1.8 users indefinitely; after all,
we only accepted a patch for 1.8.6 compatibility less than a year
ago(!)[1].   So I'll still feel a _little_ bad for dropping 1.8 :x

One big reason for this is it looks like Ruby will move towards
deprecating old Data_* macros for superior (1.9+-only) TypedData_*
macros in the next few years[2].  The theme for unicorn 5 is mostly
dropping old, unused crap anyways; and not gaining new bloat.

Worst case is we support 1.8 and avoid deprecation warnings through
the use of ifdefs in the HTTP parser, but I'm no fan of ifdefs.

    (construct listener_fds Hash in 1.8.6 compatible way)

[2] http://svn.ruby-lang.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi?view=revision&revision=47717
    This is due to type-checking issues like
    https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/10296
