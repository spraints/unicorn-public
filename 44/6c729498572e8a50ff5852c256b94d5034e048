I don't know if you pay attention to rack-devel, but I've posted
a proposal (patches || pull request) to undeprecate Rack::Chunked, here:
https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/rack-devel/20220901214536.5469-1-e%4080x24.org

Or if you don't want to deal with Google and want to view the whole thread +
automated patch application from hunk-header links:
