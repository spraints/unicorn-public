Again, the answer is "no".  I do not want people to depend on unicorn
providing a stable API of any sort.  Even if in practice and history
it does: the config file directives and internal constant names
haven't changed at all in 5-6 years and there are no plans to change it.

That's not a real compatibility bug with unicorn itself.  Again, it's
wrong of them to have a dependency on any Rack server at all.

I am only doing plain-text email.  I'm done with websites requiring
login + registration.
