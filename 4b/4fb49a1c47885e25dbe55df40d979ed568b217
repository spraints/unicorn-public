Hi skaar,

Does having this in the Unicorn config file work for you?

  stash_env = %w(PATH RUBYOPT).map { |x| [ x, ENV[x] ] }
  before_exec do |_|
    stash_env.each { |(k,v)| ENV[k] = v }
  end

It's more generic and less surprising for people that (may) want
to change environment variables on upgrades:

Early versions of Unicorn actually captured the entire ENV at startup
and restored it before exec.  I felt it was too heavy-handed since I
figured any process that changed its environment variables has good
reason to do so, so I've been trying to leave as much alone as
possible...
