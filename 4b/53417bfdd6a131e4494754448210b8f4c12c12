We're using Unicorn to serve a Rails app on a few app servers built on
Amazon EC2 instances. Each of the xlarge EC2 instances have the
equivalent of 8 CPUs, but it seems like our Unicorn master and 8
workers are only utilizing the first CPU. We've been watching the CPU
graphs from collectd data when the website is under load, and only
cpu-0 shows any activity ... the others seem to be idle, or minimally
used by other services.

I had assumed that the OS would automatically allocate the Unicorn
worker processes to use multiple CPUs, but now I'm not sure. I
couldn't find anything about this in the Unicorn docs (except for the
mention of the worker_processes configuration, which seems to imply
that multiple CPUs would be used). Is there something that I'm not
doing?

Our EC2 instances are running Ubuntu 10.04 LTS with Linux kernel 2.6.32.

Thanks in advance for any insights or suggestions.
