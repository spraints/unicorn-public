I'm 100% on board with your reasoning here, but I don't understand why
we can't set the pid in the config file. Am I reading this wrong?
(Very possibly.)

Doesn't this line mean that any `pid` setting in the configurator is ignore=
d:

http://git.bogomips.org/cgit/unicorn.git/tree/lib/unicorn.rb#n83

If so, how would you suggest setting the pid at runtime? I don't mean
to be difficult, we just want to keep everything in /var/run

Sounds good to me. Unicorn has quite completely convinced me that
pure-Ruby config files are the way to go. I've already done some crazy
stuff in there during our migration that a YAML file (or whatever)
just wouldn't have been able to handle.
