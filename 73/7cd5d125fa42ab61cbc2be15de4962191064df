Hi there

I have one question about related to thread in Unicorn; I have asked the
quesiton on stackoverflow.com but no one answers:

http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29180275/is-it-possible-to-create-a-thread-in-rails-subscribe-to-redis-message-channel

I also pasted the question in this email, hope that someone could help me
with this:

==============================================

I am trying to create a thread in Rails to subscribe a message channel of
Redis. Is there a way to do this? I am using unicorn.

I have tried to do this in the unicorn configuration like this:

after_fork do |server, worker|

  Thread.new do
    begin
      $redis.subscribe(:one, :two) do |on|
        on.subscribe do |channel, subscriptions|
          puts "Subscribed to ##{channel} (#{subscriptions} subscriptions)"
        end
        on.message do |channel, message|
          puts "##{channel}: #{message}"
          $redis.unsubscribe if message == "exit"
        end
        on.unsubscribe do |channel, subscriptions|
          puts "Unsubscribed from ##{channel} (#{subscriptions} subscriptions)"
        end
      end
    rescue Redis::BaseConnectionError => error
      puts "#{error}, retrying in 1s"
      sleep 1
      retry
    end
  endend

But it will make the unicorn server unable to handle any web request. I
thought that if I am using a different thread to subscribe to Redis, it
won't block the main thread; am I missing something here?
