Because other people are _always_ slow to upgrade :)

However, I suppose it's fine to bring the requirement up with a
major version bump of Rack.  I don't want to burden you with
old cruft, either.

unicorn may also be able to drop the dependency on rack by
lazy loading:

* Rack::Utils::HTTP_STATUS_CODES is the main thing we use from
  Rack at runtime; and unicorn would actually function fine if
  the hash were empty; HTTP status lines would just be short
  and non-descriptive.

* The Rack::Builder dependency can be optional, even.

Fwiw, I plan to support Rack 1.x and Ruby 1.9.3 under unicorn for a few
more years because of LTS distros.  New versions take priority, of
course.

Ah, you're right.  I was looking at the gemspec which is distributed
with the gem source and not the regenerated gemspec which RubyGems
actually uses.

So yeah, it looks like Adam's patch only affects the gem build process.
