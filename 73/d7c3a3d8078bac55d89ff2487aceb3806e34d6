Please don't send HTML portions in email, it will be flagged as spam
and not checked frequently as it wastes my bandwidth and storage.

Can you post your nginx error log and see if there's anything there?
What happens if you point your browser directly at unicorn to hit
the getTranslationLanguages endpoint directly?

Thanks.


(Also, don't expect me to post on any websites regarding unicorn;
 I work on web servers because I can't stand web browsers :P)
