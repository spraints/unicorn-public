Maybe this should be on the website somewhere, but the mailing list
archives are quite accessible nowadays.

Fwiw, I tend to followup publically (anonymized content) with technical
stuff to the private email address <unicorn@bogomips.org>, but never
publically address the non-technical questions.  But some of the same
questions come up over and over, so I figure an FAQ might help.


Q: Can I use your logo?

A: What logo?  This project has never had a logo and never will.
   Logos are a waste of bandwidth, processing power, and
   yet-another potential exploitable code execution and/or
   denial-of-service vector.

   Ask the webmaster of the site you saw the logo on.


Q: Can you speak at so-and-so conference?

A: I do not speak.  Speech is synchronous and I will inevitably
   speak too fast for some, too slow for others; all while wasting
   CPU power and bandwidth to encode and distribute audio.

   Text is much more efficient as the reader can read at their
   own pace, skim over uninteresting parts, scan, etc.
   Text is far cheaper to distribute, archive and search than audio.

   Besides, unicorn has been technically obsolete since the early 90s,
   there's nothing interesting to talk about.  Read the source,
   mailing list archives, git commit history, etc. instead.


Q: May I interview you?

A: You already started :)  I have plain-text email and nothing else.
