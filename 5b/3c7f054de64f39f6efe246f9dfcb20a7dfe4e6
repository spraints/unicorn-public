unicorn has no future, but at least some of our past is archived.

This was taken from nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.lang.ruby.mongrel.devel
as the HTTP parts of gmane are dead.  Unfortunately, Gmane only
started archiving mongrel-development@rubyforge.org in 2008 and
discussions prior to that may be lost.  If anybody has mbox, Maildir
or MH archives from those days, I'd be glad to import them.
