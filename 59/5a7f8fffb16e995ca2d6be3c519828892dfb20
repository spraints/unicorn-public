Hi all.  We use unicorn in production across four servers, behind
nginx and HAProxy (to load balance).  We set a 300s timeout in the
config file.  On an average day, we see something like:

E, [2015-01-22T17:01:24.335600 #4311] ERROR -- : worker=2 PID:21101
timeout (301s > 300s), killing

in our logs, ~60 times.  However, one day we noticed that production
had gone down with all the unicorns showing entries like the
following:

E, [2015-01-22T12:35:15.643020 #4311] ERROR -- : worker=1 PID:4605
timeout (451s > 300s), killing

(note the 451s before it was killed).

Any clues how we can better-understand the root cause, even if it's
something we'll put in place for the future?  We lack visibility here.

Thanks in advance,

Antony
