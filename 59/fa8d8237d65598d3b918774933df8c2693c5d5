Excellent points Michael.  But to Bráulio's original request, it would 
be lovely to factor out the clean and robust process management parts of 
unicorn (daemonization, pidfile-mgmt, pre-load, fork, reap, signaling) 
separate from the HTTP/Rack server.  This would give us a robust 
supervisor for asynchronous workers that reduce memory footprint with 
CoW and responds to a well understood set of signals for management.
