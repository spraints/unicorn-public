Hello all,

I've just tested a one instance each (one worker with unicorn and
--max-pool-size 1 passenger 5) on the rails app I work.

And the results are just as I expected, no miracle at all: Unicorn is
still the fatest!
(the difference is only a few milliseconds less per request)

The blocking design of unicorn is proving itself very efficient.

cheers!
