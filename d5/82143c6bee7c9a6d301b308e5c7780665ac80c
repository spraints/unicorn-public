Awesome. Thanks! Hope this would also be helpful for others.

Just got managed to send a test mail to myself. I realized that my git is
using /usr/bin/perl instead of /usr/local/bin/perl, so that instead of running
`cpan Net::SMTP::SSL` I have to run `sudo -H /usr/bin/cpan Net::SMTP::SSL`
following instructions from this site:
http://kbase.wincent.com/old/knowledge-base/Installing_Net::SMTP::SSL_for_sending_patches_with_Git_over_secure_SMTP.html

I'll send the patch shortly after updating the commit message.
Feel free to edit it as usual :)
And should I send patches for rainbows and zbatery as well?
