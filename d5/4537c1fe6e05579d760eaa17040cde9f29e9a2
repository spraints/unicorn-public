Nope.  It's only intended to talk to nginx over a Unix domain
socket on the same host, or nginx on a fast private LAN.  Having
something like varnish or haproxy in between nginx and unicorn
is fine, too, but they must either be on the same host or fast
LAN.

It fails horribly (by design :>) when talking to the open Internet
or any high-latency clients.
