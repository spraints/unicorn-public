It was a 7 minute period.  All of the workers would become busy and exceed their >120s timeout.  Master would kill and re-spawn them, they'd start to respond to a handful of requests (anywhere from 5-50) after which they'd become "busy" again, and get force killed by master.  This pattern happened 3 times over a 7 minute period.

No

No swap activity or high load.  Our munin graphs indicate a peak of web/app server disk latency around that time, although our graphs show many other similar peaks, without incident.

We can't blame virtualization as we're on dedicated hardware.

Nothing interesting in /var/log/messages.  dmesg (no timestamps) includes lines like:

TCP: Treason uncloaked! Peer ###.###.###.###:63554/80 shrinks window 1149440448:1149447132. Repaired.

We're on RHEL 5.6.
