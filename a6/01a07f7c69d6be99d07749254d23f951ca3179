my reason for intending to run worker_connections=1 isn't avoiding threading issues, but to allow app reloads without leaving around old instances of the app in server processes that are handling a 2+ hour upload. I passed on Rainbows::Base just because of the "not intended for production use" comment in the docs.

ah, that's a good point. I'll be fronting through Pound for SSL, but having the server process limit upload size would be worthwhile.

I trust them to not do that on purpose, but that doesn't mean a lot. :/
