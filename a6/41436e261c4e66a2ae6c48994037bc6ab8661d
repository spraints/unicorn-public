Subject: Master hooks needed

Hello all,

If I need to hook something after master load, I'm currently doing:

before_fork do |server, worker|
  # worker 0 is the first to init, so hold the master here
  if worker.nr =3D=3D 0
     #warm up server...

     #kill old pid...
  end

  # other stuff for each worker
end

Both operations I currently do (server warm up and old pid kill) need
to be run only once, and not for every worker as before_fork does,
that's why I had to put the condition seen above.

So hooks for master is needed, something like
master_after_load(server) and master_init(server).

What do you think?

cheers,
