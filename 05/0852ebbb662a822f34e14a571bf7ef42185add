Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.5.0 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and
Message-ID: <20190304011502.GA30650@dcvr>

unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Disclaimer:

Due to its ability to tolerate crashes and isolate clients, unicorn
is unfortunately known to prolong the existence of bugs in applications
and libraries which run on top of it.

unicorn 5.5.0

Mostly identical to 5.5.0.pre1, which I didn't hear any feedback
from:

Otherwise, there's one extra change to use
rb_gc_register_mark_object which is finally a documented part of
the Ruby C-API, but has existed since the 1.9 days.
