Wow, that is frightening... People will actually wait for a web
page to load in that case?  I guess that's why ccc exists :>

Interesting.  I guess for now, you can use nginx or similar to
route to differently-configured unicorns with different timeouts
(or even other servers)?

Anyways, I'm coming around to reconciling the two mindsets of
"typical" code running on unicorn ("it's alright to crash")
and the "no room for error: nuclear war starts if you screw up"
mindset I adopt for other projects.

Yeah, that got me thinking of improving core timeouts again...

One big problem is the lack of a portable standard asynchronous
name resolution mechanism in the C standard library.  I'm not
sure how well resolv.rb/resolv-replace.rb holds up in real-world
usage, nor if pulling in something like ares2 would be an
acceptable dependency for ruby-core...

Cool, good to know.
