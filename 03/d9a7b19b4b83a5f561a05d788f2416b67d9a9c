USR1 only affects logging to regular files, so is unlikely to help
in your case.

Are you using preload_app true or false?  If true, perhaps some shared
resource (socket or temporary file) isn't being handled correctly?

I'm not familiar with the "logging" or "logging-rails" gems.
I took a brief look at them but couldn't figure anything out,
can you ask the author of those gems?

If you do figure something out, please let the list know so it can
possibly help others in the future.
