I agree with Gary here.  It's often too easy to decide to preserve the
status quo because things work well enough -- and then, eventually, time
catches up with you and it no longer does.

If Gary's proposal makes sense, and improves matters without doing
significant harm -- despite it not adhering to the letter of Rack
compliance as it is currently specified today -- it would represent a major
step forward if implemented in Unicorn.  (And as Gary suggested, the
specification and other implementors will probably catch up by necessity if
the behavior proves beneficial.)

The first step is to prove it's worth shaking the tree with some
benchmarks, though. :)
