Subject: [ANN] unicorn 4.9.0 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and *nix

Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Changes:

  unicorn 4.9.0 - TempfileReaper support in Rack 1.6

  This release supports the Rack::TempfileReaper middleware found
  in rack 1.6 for cleaning up disk space used by temporary files.
  We also use Rack::TempfileReaper for cleaning up large temporary
  files buffered with TeeInput.  Users on rack 1.5 and earlier
  will see no changes.

  There's also a bunch of documentation/build system improvements.

  This is likely to be the last Ruby 1.8-compatible release, unicorn 5.x
  will require 1.9.3 or later as well as dropping lots of cruft (the
  stupid "Status:" header in responses being the most notable).
