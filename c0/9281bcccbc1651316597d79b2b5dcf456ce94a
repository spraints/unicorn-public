I'm pretty happy to say this daemons setup is working beautifully on
three production rails apps (10 workers each). It is really nice to
have one pid/master process for the entire app, to know unicorn master
restarts the daemons if they crash (which sometimes happens with
delayed_job), and to restart the app and daemons all by once (with
USR2 signal), and fast!

Thanks Eric and other unicorn developers!

cheers,
