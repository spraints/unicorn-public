Hi Surendra,

Could you be hitting a timeout in your Apache config?  Can you try
simulating a slow connection to reproduce it?  Apache defaults to 300s,
too, so double check your config and make sure it's not different
anymore.   The other thing could be your kernel listen queue used by
Unicorn is completely full and Apache is just giving up on certain
requests...

While it's generally bad for Unicorn to run behind anything other than
nginx, "generally bad" does not apply to the case of file uploads.

Honestly, when dealing with file uploads from slow clients,
Unicorn is the WORST SERVER YOU COULD EVER PICK.  EVER :)

Really, trust me on this one :)


Use nginx, but if you insist on using Apache, then you're far better off
sticking with Mongrel or trying out Rainbows![1] for uploads.

Rainbows! has the advantage of using Unicorn's prefork and shared
listeners along with your choice of threads/fibers/events/fibers/actors.
