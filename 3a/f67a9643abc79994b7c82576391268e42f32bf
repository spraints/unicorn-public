Subject: [PATCH 0/2] no avoiding rack.hijack anymore

I'm not sure if it makes sense to use rack.hijack with a prefork server
like unicorn which only works behind nginx, but maybe somebody does...

Eric Wong (2):
      http_request: support rack.hijack by default
      avoid extra allocation for hijack proc creation
