OK, I agree making RAILS_ENV==RACK_ENV in deployments is less confusing.
(unicorn should continue NOT enforcing this internally, though)

*sigh*  :<

I kinda wish there was no default middleware, either.  But it's
too late to change unicorn defaults.

I think your -N/--no-default-middleware patch can be accepted,
then.  after_app_load is more prone to user error/confusion, I think
(I believe RAILS_ENV/RACK_ENV should be frozen for the lifetime of
 the process)

Can you try send-email again with the --no-default-middleware patch? :)

The git-send-email(1) manpage has several good examples for your email
provider.  There's also git-imap-send which you can use to stick email
in your Drafts folder, but I've never needed/used it, though.
