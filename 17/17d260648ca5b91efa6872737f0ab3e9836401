Hello Hongli,

Thank you the guide, I've already learned a bit from it.

We already use nginx for static files and ssl and varnish for caching
public pages, so maybe turbocaching won't help too much.

In this test I've tested passenger in standalone mode (--max-pool-size
1) and unicorn with one worker. On a slow page, the variation was
minimal (~8.26 req/s in unicorn and ~8.11 in passenger). I haven't
tested fast and cacheable page.

Also, I've used ab for benchmarking. Next time will try wrk.

cheers,
br=C3=A1ulio
