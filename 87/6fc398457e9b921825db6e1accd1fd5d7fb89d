Let me explain a problem I had with Sequel and Unicorn (already solved), =

perhaps it's related:


I load Sequel database toolkit in the master process so it generates its ow=
n =

threads pool.
Then Unicorn forks into workers but each worker uses the same instance of =

Sequel database, this is, the same threads pool.

This causes errors since some thread could be used by different processes a=
t =

the same time.

The solution is simple:

Don't set the Sequel instance in the master process, instead do it in each =

worker ("after_fork" block in unicorn config file).

In this way each process has its own Sequel instance with its own threads =

pool.

Also, using Sequel thread pool makes no sense when using Unicorn as each =

worker is single thread, so I gain some performance by setting =

"single_threaded =3D true" in Sequel database configuration (no thread pool =

stuff).

Probably you are getting a similar issue due to ActiveRecord or any other =

multithread library you load in the master process so the instance is share=
d =

between all the workers.
