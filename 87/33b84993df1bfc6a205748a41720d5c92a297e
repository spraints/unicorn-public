Weird.  I'm doubtful TCP sockets would solve your problems but let me
know if it fixes it.  UNIX and TCP sockets follow exactly the same code
paths once the server is running so I'm not sure what could be the issue
(especially since you're sending a body-less GET request).  Maybe OSX
has some weird rules/bugs with UNIX sockets (I've heard of issues with
FIFOs on OSX), but I don't have access to an OSX machine.

Is your "GET / HTTP/1.1" request supposed to be taking over 60s?  60
seconds is the default (and IMHO very conservative) timeout for when
Unicorn decides to terminate a request.

0.8.1 should actually be considered production-ready.  It doesn't
support chunked transfer-encoding; but otherwise it's been running
fine for some internal APIs for quite a while now.

Thanks for giving it a shot!
