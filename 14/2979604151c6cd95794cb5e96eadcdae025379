Thanks for that note.  2 things:

1. Ugh.  That sort disregard for compatibility at the expense of making
   things "better" is why I and most people I've known no longer do new
   projects in Ruby :<  Heck, I started rewriting many of unicorn's tests
   in Perl5 a few weeks ago since I want to be able to trust them decades
   from now.

2. I suppose unicorn will continue letting misbehaving apps have
   their way.  It would be nice if developers consistently
   tested with Rack::Lint, of course

Now I wonder if case/when === behavior will break someday...
