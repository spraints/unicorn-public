Interesting!  I'm honestly a bit disappointed it's not a generic Rack
app and depends on certain server features, but the project seems mostly
inline with my interests.

But if I were to run it, I'd remove all CSS+images+JS and might
contribute a patch to disable that all, too :)

Anyways, subscribed to the mailing list :>
