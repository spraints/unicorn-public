Thanks, patch looks good; though I'd like to confirm

Which kernel are you running?
Modern kernels prefix that condition with:

	if (nr_pages > pipe->buffers &&

Scanning kernel changes with `git log -p -L:pipe_set_size:fs/pipe.c',
I see that check was added in b0b91d18e2e97b741b294af9333824ecc3fadfd8
("pipe: fix limit checking in pipe_set_size()")
which was fixed in Linux v4.9+ and v3.16.57+

Agreed.  Applied, tested and pushed to master as
commit 5c613c6ea98541df587193e861364c858a8a0abd
Thanks!

Will tag and release v5.5.1 in a day or two.
