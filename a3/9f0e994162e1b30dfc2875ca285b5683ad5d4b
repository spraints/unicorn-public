Do you have any other requests in your logs which could be taking
a long time and hogging workers, but not high enough to trigger the
unicorn kill timeout.

(enable $request_time in nginx access logs if you haven't already)

Is this with Unix or TCP sockets?  If it's over a LAN, maybe there's
still a bad switch/port/cable somewhere (that happens often to me).

With Unix sockets, I don't recall encountering recent problems under
Linux.  Which OS are you running?

I hit several TCP bugs in the early 3.7 Linux kernels, too...
