OpenBSD seems to support the constants you are using in raindrops:

#define TCPS_CLOSED             0       /* closed */
#define TCPS_LISTEN             1       /* listening for connection */
#define TCPS_SYN_SENT           2       /* active, have sent syn */
#define TCPS_SYN_RECEIVED       3       /* have sent and received syn */
#define TCPS_ESTABLISHED        4       /* established */
#define TCPS_CLOSE_WAIT         5       /* rcvd fin, waiting for close */
#define TCPS_FIN_WAIT_1         6       /* have closed, sent fin */
#define TCPS_CLOSING            7       /* closed xchd FIN; await ACK */
#define TCPS_LAST_ACK           8       /* had fin and close; await FIN ACK */
#define TCPS_FIN_WAIT_2         9       /* have closed, fin is acked */
#define TCPS_TIME_WAIT          10      /* in 2*msl quiet wait after close */

I'm fine with dropping raindrops as a unicorn dependency and making it
optional if it isn't necessary for correct operation.

Thanks,
Jeremy
