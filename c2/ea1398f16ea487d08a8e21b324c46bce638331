Previously, when I sent a SIGUSR2 to Unicorn, I generally saw this happen:

(1)  The PID file was renamed (or copied) to include .oldbin
(2)  The new instance started spinning up, and create a new .pid file.
(3)  At some point, the old instance would be told to shut down from my unicorn.rb file, once workers started.
(4)  The .oldbin would go away.

What I appear to be seeing now, with 4.7.0, is:

(1)  The PID file is removed.
(2)  The new instance spins up, but until it starts its first worker, no .pid file is created.

I don't mind the new behavior particularly, but it did surprise me a bit.  Is this new behavior working as intended?
