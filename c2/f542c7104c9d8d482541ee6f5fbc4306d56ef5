unicorn is over 5 years old, things are still kicking, but
has not changed much since it was first announced in 2009:
   http://mid.gmane.org/20090211230457.GB22926@dcvr.yhbt.net [1]

So 5 will be the next major version, but there's nothing earth
shattering and probably nothing visible to the majority of users.
Almost all just internal housekeeping:

* (finally) remove Unicorn::HttpParser#reset

* switch to minitest5 (or test-unit2?)

* drop some things that were intended for Rainbows!
  - keepalive_requests, not necessary with the MT/one-shot-based event
    loops like yahns, this is only intended as a DoS mitigation measure for
    single-threaded event loops (nginx) or pure-MT-based servers
  - xftrust (long deprecated)

* cleanup tests, port shell script integration tests to shunit2?
  (or making the tests pure Ruby is probably fine, I trust the stability
  of the Ruby language more today than I did in 2009 with the painful
  1.8->1.9 transition)

* extract terminal-friendly coverage output from yahns into a gem
  and use it for unicorn.

Tangentially related things to do:

* reduce memory usage in Ruby so users may run more unicorns

* improve reverse proxy support in yahns so it may be an
  alternative to nginx for unicorn users

What else?

[1] Supporting the project with only email is probably the only
    reason I haven't given up after all these years.
