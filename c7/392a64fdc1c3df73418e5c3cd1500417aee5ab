For those of you unfortunate enough to be stuck behind firewalls
or rely on crap webmail interfaces, you can pass the:

   --smtp-server-port=587 --smtp-server=bogomips.org

options to "git send-email" when sending patches/plain-text mail
to unicorn-public@bogomips.org

You'll still need a valid From: address to receive replies and
participate in the discussion if you're not subscribed to the
mailing list.

Note: "git send-email" can send regular plain-text emails with
valid Subject: and From: headers.  If you're not familiar with
email message headers, they're nearly identical to HTTP, and
you can use "git format-patch"-generated patches as a guide.

Caveats:

- This will expose your client IP address to the world
  (but many existing mail setups do that anyways)

- This will not work for Cc-ing others in replies directly,
  but works for all @bogomips.org email addresses,
  so you may want to add "--suppress-cc=all" or similar.

Patchbomb away! :D
