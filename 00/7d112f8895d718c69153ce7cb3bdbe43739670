Thanks, Lawrence.

ENV pollution was indeed the problem. The aforementioned exception was
being caused by by Bundler 0.7 having set ENV['RUBYOPT'] to
"-r<application root>/gems/environment.rb". After clearing that and
setting my paths properly it worked.

Thank you very much for pointing me in the right direction.
