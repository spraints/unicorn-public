Eric,

I have been unable to narrow down the cause of the conflict so far.  The list of Ruby gems (and gem versions) on the affected deployment are identical to the ones on another deployment where Unicorn is upgrading just fine (with preloaded app).  Grep'ing for USR2 in the gem installations did not reveal anything,  unfortunately.  Since then, I haven't been able to spend further time investigating.  Not sure where else to look, really, but I'm open to further suggestions.

-Jeff

Btw, did you ever figure out what was causing the conflict?

 Occasionally odd {issues}[link:ISSUES.html] arise without a transparent or  acceptable solution.  Those issues are documented here.
