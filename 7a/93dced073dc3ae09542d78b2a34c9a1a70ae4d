Ugh, I guess your employer doesn't want you fixing Linux kernel bugs,
either :<

OK, I suggest setting up mirrors on repo.or.cz or somewhere
else, as well, for redundancy and accessibility behind
blockades/firewalls.

Understood; but I'm not in favor of having generated files in
version control due to noise from needless diffs/dirty-states.

And I just had problems in another project because of generated
hunks the other day.

I suggest pointing the gemfile towards your own repo and
rebasing this patch on top of upstream, instead.

Minor changes to the .rl files (or Ragel itself) can lead noisy
comment/whitespace changes; and a constant dirty index if two
contributors are using different revisions of Ragel[1].

I encounter constant dirty index with autotools and gnulib-using
projects across different systems, too; and it's a PITA to deal
with when trying to fix platform-specific bugs.

That's a regression, a version based on `git describe'
can be quite informative, especially when somebody isn't
sure if they've loaded the correct version or not.



[1] on a side note, I started getting rid of the Ragel dependency
    last year (replacing with vendored picohttpparser), but got
    sidetracked with Real-Life crap which I'm still dealing with.
    The problem is Ragel 7 (experimental) won't be compatible with
    6, and FreeBSD only packages 7 while Debian-based is staying
    with 6 for now.  There were nasty incompatibilities going from
    Ragel 5->6 back in the Mongrel days, too; so I'd rather just go
    with a standalone C parser I've been abusing elsewhere.
