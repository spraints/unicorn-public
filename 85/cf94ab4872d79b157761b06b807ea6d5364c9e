I have tested with 5 workers and still the same issue.
It=B4s strange=2C If this is happening to everyone=2C it should be a more k=
nown problem. I have search everywhere in Internet and I couldn=B4t find an=
ything related to it.
My guess is that probably I have something in my Rails code related to sess=
ions or cookies that is handled in a different way in the browsers but it=
=B4s also related to the application server.
I don=B4t know. But although I feel really curious with the isssue and I wo=
uld love to find it out=2C I think I will try with Puma.
Thank you so much for your time.
