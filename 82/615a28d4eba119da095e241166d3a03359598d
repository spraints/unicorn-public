Right, but raciness goes for anything regarding pid files.

The OS does make an effort to avoid recycling PIDs too often,
and going through all the PIDs in a system quickly is
probably rare.  I haven't hit it, at least.

It's still racy in a different way, though (file could change right
after checking).

Having the process start time in /proc be unreliable because the server
has the wrong time is also in the same category of corner cases.

Also, can you check the inode of the /proc/$pid entry?  Perhaps

PID files are horrible, really :<
