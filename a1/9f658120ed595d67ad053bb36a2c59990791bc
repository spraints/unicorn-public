Don't send HTML parts, it is flagged as spam and nearly lost.

Onto your question...

I wrote this patch a while ago to a private bug reporter (via
unicorn@bogomips.org) back in July 2013, but apparently it
was forgotten:

I don't recall it breaks anything, so perhaps it's a good change to make
for unicorn 5.

I don't think using DEBUG is a good idea to hack around a problem,
but rather detecting whether stdin is a TTY as above is a better check.

The archives are also mirrored to gmane.org and mail-archive.com,
so they should be searchable from either of those.

The mailing list archives are cloneable via git:
  git clone --bare git://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/

And the tree layout is described at:
  http://ssoma.public-inbox.org/ssoma_repository.txt
  (it's not meant to be cloned without --bare)

You can currently use the ssoma command-line (at ssoma.public-inbox.org)
tool to import the archives into a mbox/maildir and search using tools
such as mairix/notmuch/etc...

The existing HTML archives at http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/ should
be easily crawlable by search engines (no JS, frames, CSS or images),
but a Xapian-based search might happen in the future (that would also
help with maintaining stable IDs for read-only NNTP support).
