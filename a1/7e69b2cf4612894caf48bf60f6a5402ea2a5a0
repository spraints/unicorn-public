Subject: Shared Metrics Between Workers

Hello,

I was wondering if anyone can offer any advice in handling stats
collections between worker processes in forking servers (like unicorn).
Specifically, I am attempting to work on a solution for the Prometheus ruby
gem. Some details are in this issue here:
https://github.com/prometheus/client_ruby/issues/9

Prometheus works with a "scrape" model, where every few seconds a
prometheus server hits a http endpoint that exposes status. With the
current middleware the stats will only represent whichever worker is hit.

I have read through the documentation for unicorn and poked around the
source code some  -- as well as searched for similar projects for
inspiration.

The earliest, promising solution I considered was raindrops, but it looks
as though you need to know all of the possible metrics up front - which
won't necessarily work as prometheus could use metrics based on parameters
which could vary.

Does anyone have any experience working with something like this?

Thanks for any suggestions.
