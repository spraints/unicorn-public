It seems you're missing /etc/init.d/myzippykid in your pastes.

Are you sending SIGQUIT (or SIGTERM) to the old unicorn master?
If you have old workers servicing requests, the old master will wait
until all the old workers are done.

Since your timeout is 60s, everything (workers and master) should exit
around that time period if you have stalled/long-running requests,
though.
