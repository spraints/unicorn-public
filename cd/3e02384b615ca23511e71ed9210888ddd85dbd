I tried your after_fork hook with the following config.ru
and it prints out $unicorn_uptime fine:

-------------------- config.ru --------------------------
use Rack::ContentLength
use Rack::ContentType, 'text/plain'
run lambda { |env| [ 200, {}, [ "#$unicorn_uptime\n"] ] }
---------------------------------------------------------

Perhaps you have something else in your app clobbering globals?

Also, please don't send any HTML parts in mail, it is spammy and wastes
bandwidth/storage.  Your message would've been seen much sooner if it
hadn't been flagged as spam.  Thanks.
