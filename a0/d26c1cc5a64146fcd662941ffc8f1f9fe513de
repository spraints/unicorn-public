Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.6.0 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and *nix
Message-ID: <20200726015540.GA4867@dcvr>
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii

unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Disclaimer:

Due to its ability to tolerate crashes and isolate clients, unicorn
is unfortunately known to prolong the existence of bugs in applications
and libraries which run on top of it.

Consider this just an announcement to inform existing users of a
new version, not something to convince you to switch to something
that set the entire Ruby world back decades in terms of concurrency.
