`nil` or `false`?  With how unicorn uses it, it doesn't matter,
but it should really be `false` there based on reading the
rb_io_isatty function in io.c of the MRI source.

But anyways, I suspect ForeGO redirects the stdin to /dev/null
(you can check with lsof); which is totally reasonable for
running daemons.

That is why I recommended the before_fork workaround to
trap(:WINCH, "DEFAULT") to restore the default noop behavior.
