Hi David,

I would set those in the init/deploy script you're using.  REE picks up
those variables at startup before it ever sees Unicorn.

However, if you want to change/modify them once your site is live
without downtime, then you should be able to change them anywhere in the
Unicorn config file (any valid Ruby can be in there, so just
ENV["FOO"] = "BAR") and then SIGUSR2 to upgrade the process (and
SIGQUIT the old master).  It doesn't look like you can affect the
running process with those GC settings, but environment variables
are carried across fork + exec so the new one can pick them up at
interpreter startup.

Actually, with the latest versions you should be able to just do this:

  worker.user "mongrel", "mongrel"

No problem, let us know how it goes!
