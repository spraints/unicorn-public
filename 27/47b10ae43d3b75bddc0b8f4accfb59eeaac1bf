Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between Unicorn and slow clients.

Changes:

There are only minor changes since 0.991.0.

For users clinging onto the past, MRI 1.8.6 support has been
restored.  Users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to the
latest 1.8.7, REE or 1.9.1.

For users looking towards the future, the core test suite and
the Rails 3 (beta) integration tests pass entirely under 1.9.2
preview3.  As of the latest rubinius.git[1], Rubinius support is
nearly complete as well.

Under Rubinius, signals may corrupt responses as they're being
written to the socket, but that should be fixable transparently
to us[4].  Support for the hardly used, hardly documented[2]
embedded command-line switches in rackup config (.ru) files is
is also broken under Rubinius.

The recently-released Rack 1.2.1 introduced no compatiblity
issues[3] in core Unicorn.  We remain compatible with all Rack
releases starting with 0.9.1 (and possibly before).

[1] tested with Rubinius upstream commit
cf4a5a759234faa3f7d8a92d68fa89d8c5048f72
[2] lets avoid the Dueling Banjos effect here :x
[3] actually, Rack 1.2.1 is broken under 1.8.6.

The Future:

* Bug/compatibility fixes as needed, of course!
* Scalability for hardware that may be common in 5-10 years
* Rainbows!  LOTS of Rainbows!

Thanks for reading!
