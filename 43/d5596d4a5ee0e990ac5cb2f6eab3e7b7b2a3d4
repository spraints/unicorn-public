Cranking up the timeout will improve its chances of being swapped out.
If memory usage of an infrequently used instance is a concern.

Right, it's currently not possible to influence the master.  And I'm
not convinced it's the right way to go, either.

What I've done in the past is to put the client in a periodic refresh
loop (meta refresh or whatever tag it was) and have it poll the app
while it was waiting for a long-running job to finish.  I think it was
(or still is) a common thing...

Btw, Rubyforge delayed this email by over 3 weeks?  But then again you
responded to a 6 month old thread %x
