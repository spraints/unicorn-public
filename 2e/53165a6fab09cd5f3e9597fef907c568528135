Until now, it was unproven.  AFAIK, no other app server does
anything similar.

Maybe other servers/protocols have similar things, I'd love to know.

On Linux, tcpi_last_data_recv in the structure returned by TCP_INFO
tells you when the last packet was received on the socket, so it's an
accurate indication of queue time.  Raindrops provides an interface for
accessing it:

  http://raindrops.bogomips.org/Raindrops/LastDataRecv.html

I haven't heard much feedback about it, though.

Using SystemTap (or similar solutions), I think the same information may
be retrieved without modifying the Ruby process.  I'm just starting my
exploration of SystemTap, though...

Raindrops::Watcher is less accurate/informative, but can run without
modifying the process.  I've used this heavily, but haven't
found anything interesting since I don't get enough traffic.
