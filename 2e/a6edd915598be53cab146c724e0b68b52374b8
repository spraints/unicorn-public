Subject: [PATCH] t0011-active-unix-socket.sh: fix race condition in test
Date: Tue, 28 Feb 2017 23:00:25 +0000
Message-Id: <20170228230025.18558-1-e@80x24.org>
List-Id: <unicorn-public@bogomips.org>

Killing the master process may lead to the worker dying on its
own (as designed); before kill(1) has had an opportunity to send
the second kill(2) syscall on the worker process.

Killing the worker before the master might also lead to a
needless respawn, so merely kill the master and let the worker
follow it in death.

This race condition occasionally caused test failures on slow,
uniprocessor hardware.
