OK, the problem should be reproducible hitting unicorn directly (easy to
configure a TCP listener) and eliminating nginx as a possible
point-of-failure.  Also, I suggest using curl so you can script and see
everything going on more easily at the protocol/syscall level.

OK, the main culprit is usually external connections acting up.  Postgres,
external monitoring services, network failures, etc...

What does the CPU usage look like?

Basically, minimize and isolate things.  Use a single worker, strace
that worker ("strace -f -p $PID_OF_WORKER") and send a request to it
using curl.

Is the Postgres doing OK?  How is the network connection to that?
What other external resources (monitoring services, memcached, redis,
etc...) might you be hitting?  You'll see blocking (on things like
read*/write*/select/poll/recvmsg/sendmsg) on strace.

You can map numeric file descriptors to ports via:
 lsof -p $PID_OF_WORKER

Also, is your server running out of entropy?  (You'll see blocking on
reading /dev/random via strace) and you may also see low values in
/proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
