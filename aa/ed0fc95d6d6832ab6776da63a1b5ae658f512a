I don't *think* so.  Most requests finish <300ms.  We do have some more intensive code-paths, but they're administrative and called much less frequently.  Most of these pages complete in <3seconds.

For requests that made it to rails logging, the LAST processed request before the worker timed-out all completed very quickly (and no real pattern in terms of which page may be triggering it.)

I'll enable this.

TCP sockets, with nginx and unicorn running on the same box.

Stock RHEL 5, kernel 2.6.18.

Thanks again,
