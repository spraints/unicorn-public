  Hi Justin,

See the paragraph "Other ENV pollution issues" at

Cheers,

> Hello,
>
> First off, many thanks to all those who have contributed to this great
> project. I have been running Unicorn in production for quite some time
> now. It hass been very reliable and I have really enjoyed being able
> to deploy frequently without downtime or even dropped connections.
>
> I have used the USR2+QUIT upgrade procedure as described in SIGNALS
> since I started using Unicorn and it works great. However, while
> upgrading Bundler on my server the other day, an upgrade failed for
> the first time. The upgrade failed due to a LoadError --<application
> root>/gems/environment.rb is no longer used in Bundler 1.0 so it was
> missing from the new application tree.
>
> I am using a Capistrano setup so my app is located at
> /path/to/app/current where current is a symlink to a timestamped
> release directory. I am calling #working_directory in my unicorn
> config to set it to the symlinked current path. I am also calling
> unicorn via a binstub generated by Bundler located at
> /path/to/app/current/bin/unicorn.
>
> I had expected that reexec would pick up the new unicorn and app code
> because the path to the unicorn executable script, the path to my app,
> and config files were all identical to those used in the previous
> deploy. However, this is not what is happening. Rather, it looks like
> the previous version of the code is trying to reload iteself in the
> new app tree where files are missing.
>
> I am having a very difficult time understanding exactly what files are
> being reloaded during the reexec. Even my attempts at troubleshooting
> where the load error is originating have left me completely baffled.
> In the old app gems/environment.rb is required in a few places but
> none of those files seem to be reloaded during the reexec. Further, I
> cannot get this executable swap to work no matter what I try. I have
> even tried getting rid of the symlinks entirely and changing the
> contents of the /path/to/app/current in place during the upgrade.
>
> I feel like I may be missing something obvious or else I have
> completely misunderstood how the reload process works. Any insight as
> to what I should be doing differently would be greatly appreciated.
