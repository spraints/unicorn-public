Hleb: remember to reply-all, we will never require subscription
to post to this list, so it's likely sumit never saw it.

sumit: what Hleb asked...

I suspect "preload_app true" in your config is loading something
in your app which is using up your memory.  Sometimes there's
monitoring threads which might fill a queue up or something.

Anything in error logs?  Failing that, strace (on Linux) might
tell you what's going on at the error level.

But yeah, the master process shouldn't be doing anything besides
listening to signals and respawning failed workers.

If you want to check if there's monitoring threads on Linux
systems with /proc mounted, you can see how many threads the
master has:

	ls /proc/$PID_OF_MASTER/task/

There should be two entries for Ruby 1.9-2.5(*), one being the
master PID and one for the timer-thread.  If you have more,
then that's probably some thread doing stuff in the
background...

(*) _maybe_ we can get rid of timer-thread for 2.6...
