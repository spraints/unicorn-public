I switched to olddoc recently to get rid of CSS/images and haven't
used JS for several years before that:

http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/m/20150110044934.GA1328@dcvr.yhbt.net.html

It uses the olddoc document generator: http://80x24.org/olddoc/

Nothing directly with unicorn, but the cgit web viewer at
http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git/ still has CSS.

It would be nice to make CSS optional in cgit so webmasters can disable
it.  There might be a place where it uses a on* hook for JS, too, so
that should be disable-able via config option.  Obviously I disabled
the logo long ago :)

Contributing to cgit is identical to git itself and unicorn,
except the mailing list requires subscription.
