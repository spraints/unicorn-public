Ugh.  I can't even get to that file right now.  I actually prefer
to have config files inline so:

a) I can comment easily on them
b) I don't have to be online when reading them
   (I sync my mail to a local machine and lose connectivity often)


On a side note, maybe an strace/truss can help figure out what's
going on.  James seems to be having a similar problem in the other
thread...

If you're doing it during low traffic periods, I would SIGTTOU away
most (maybe all but one) of your workers and then SIGHUP the master
