Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.0.0 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and *nix

Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Changes since 4.9.0:

unicorn 5.0.0 - most boring major release. EVER.

An evolutionary dead-end since its announcement[1] nearly six years
ago, this old-fashioned preforker has had enough bugs and missteps
that it's managed to hit version 5!

I wish I could say unicorn 5 is leaps and bounds better than 4, but
it is not.  This major version change allows us to drop some cruft
and unused features which accumulated over the years, resulting in
several kilobytes of memory saved[2]!

Compatibility:

* The horrible, proprietary (:P) "Status:" response header is
  finally gone, saving at least 16 precious bytes in every HTTP
  response.  This should make it easier to write custom HTTP clients
  which are compatible across all HTTP servers.  It will hopefully
  make migrating between different Rack servers easier for new
  projects.

* Ruby 1.8 support removed.  Ruby 1.9.3 is currently the earliest
  supported version.  However, expect minor, likely-unnoticeable
  performance regressions if you use Ruby 2.1 or earlier.  Going
  forward, unicorn will favor the latest version (currently 2.2) of
  the mainline Ruby implementation, potentially sacrificing
  performance on older Rubies.

* Some internal, undocumented features and APIs used by
  derivative servers are gone; removing bloat and slightly lowering
  memory use.  We have never and will never endorse the use of any
  applications or middleware with a dependency on unicorn,
  applications should be written for Rack instead.
  Note: Rainbows! 5.0 will be released next week or so to be
  compatible with unicorn 5.x

New features:

* sd_listen_fds(3) emulation added for systemd compatibility.
  You may now stop using PID files and other process monitoring
  software when using systemd.
