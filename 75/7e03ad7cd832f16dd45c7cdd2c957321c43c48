If so, sorry about that.

This won't affect folks reading this list over NNTP or HTTP(S),
but looks like I forgot to lock in the replay driver and it should be
fixed in ssoma:

    https://public-inbox.org/meta/20171129015224.31901-1-e@80x24.org/

(and yes, this is a test message of sorts, sorry for the noise)

As a reminder, you can also follow this list via NNTP and HTTP(S),
and it's probably more reliable since my MX may be blacklisted:
