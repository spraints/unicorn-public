I like the simplicity of your git hook deployment solution, but the
simplicity is also it's limitation.

If you are running say 2 clusters of 10 app servers, need to do
rolling deploys without downtime, stop/start things like resque, solr,
memcached all in the right order to allow for the site to continue
functioning while it's happening, then you'd probably be very happy
that capistrano exists :)

Also, what about production-only configuration, such as production db
connection params, credentials to various other services, maybe even a
payment gateway?  I would highly discourage from checking these into
your source code repo for obvious reasons.

For a single host environment i don't think it really matters, but for
anything bigger than that, capistrano is pretty awesome.  I've used it
for many years, and most recently capified a green field rails
project. It took about an hour.

Anyway, I am not married to capistrano, but I do think it's a great
tool that solves a very large pain in a consistent and programmable
way, and is certainly worth a try.
