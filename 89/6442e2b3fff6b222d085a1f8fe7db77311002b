Remained owned by root?  Yes that sounds like the problem.

Yes, the old versions of Unicorn didn't change users at all.

I always knew user-switching is a pain in the ass to deal with due to
issues like this.   Due to work on Rainbows! (designed to run on port
80) and users starting as root anyways (due to init scripts), I needed
add this feature.

It's the rotation that attempts to chown since it thinks (incorrectly)
that it's in the master process.  I'll make that more robust and release
3.6.0 sometime this week with (hopefully) a few other minor
improvements.

Thanks, that seems to be a general problem with people relying on
blog/mailing list posts instead of consistently updated documentation.
