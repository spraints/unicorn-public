No need to rely on authority, just read the source: 
https://github.com/defunkt/unicorn/blob/master/lib/unicorn/http_server.rb

Unicorn::HttpServer#pid=(path) setter writes the pid file (lines 179-206).

before_exec is called on line 439 within a fork block in 
Unicorn::HttpServer#reexec (this is the only call to before_exec in the 
code)

prior to that, self.pid= is called passing oldpid whose value is 
"#{pid}.oldbin" (lines 398-401).

[ line numbers may change if you're not looking at commit c7ba76a21c ]
