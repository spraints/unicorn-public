I'm tempted to remove these for 5.x, but maybe somebody depends on the
lib/unicorn/app/* portions somewhere... Does anybody care?

Subject: [PATCH] remove old inetd+git examples and exec_cgi

While it was technically interesting and fun to tunnel arbitrary
protocols over a semi-compliant Rack interface, nobody actually does
it (and anybody who does can look in our git history).  This was
from back in 2009 when this was one of the few servers that could
handle chunked uploads, nowadays everyone does it! (or do they? :)

A newer version of exec_cgi.rb still lives on in the repository of
yet another horribly-named server, but there's no point in bloating
the installation footprint of somewhat popular server such as unicorn.
