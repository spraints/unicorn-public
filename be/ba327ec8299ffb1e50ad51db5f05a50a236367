Thank a lot Eric.=A0
I am using Ruby 2.3.3 and Unicorn 5.3.=A0

"It sounds like somebody else is sending SIGKILL to a worker..." This line =
of yours saved my server.=A0

Actually when I uploads a file, it first goes to /tmp directory and then on=
e of the worker processes of unicorn uploads it to S3 from there. So, earli=
er when I was trying to fix timeout connection error of unicorn, I increase=
d it to 20 minutes and the problem was solved temporarily.=A0

But the problem was that the files that were uploaded temporarily to /tmp d=
irectory, those files do not get deleted from /tmp after they are uploaded =
to S3. So, I wrote a script using tmpreaper that cleans the /tmp directory =
recursively and removes the files that are 30 min older and added that to c=
ron service.=A0

After this, as a result of this script, all the files that were required to=
 be removed, were removed from /tmp directory but again a problem occurred.=
 When I used "df -h" command to check whether the files are actually delete=
d or not, it showed that the space that was taken by uploaded files on my d=
isk has not been freed :( . So, I searched internet and got to know that an=
y other process was still using those files, that was why the space on the =
disk was not freed.=A0

I used ' lsof +L1 | grep "deleted" ' command and found that a process named=
 'bundle' is still using these deleted files. So, I again wrote a script th=
at was killing the process that was using a deleted file.=A0 Script was usi=
ng this command

" lsof +L1 | grep 'deleted' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9 "

Today, after reading your words, I finally realised that my script was kill=
ing the unicorn worker itself because the command that I was using was kill=
ing the parent of "bundle" process. As "bundle" was a child of Unicorn work=
er, unicorn worker was being killed.

So, thanks a lot Eric :)=A0

I was finally able to solve this error because of the direction and hint th=
at you gave me. But the only thing that I need to find is that what is caus=
ing uploaded files to persist in /tmp directory.=A0=A0=A0
