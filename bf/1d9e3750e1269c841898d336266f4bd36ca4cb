I guess the issue is that people need to specify which server they're
using in their Gmefile when bundler is used to launch the application.

I don't think it's a good idea to bind to a specific version though.
Upgrading unicorn never breaks anything for me.

p.s. Personally I never liked the idea of semantic versioning either,
unless there's a clearly defined API like Rack's SPEC.
