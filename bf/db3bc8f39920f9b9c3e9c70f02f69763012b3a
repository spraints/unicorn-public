Hello,

I am running into some issues with these variables being set - since I =
am spawning a script from a unicorn worker (via a rails controller) I =
figured I=E2=80=99d ask here.=20

Here is the stackoverflow with the full background:
=
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29233181/why-is-envhome-nil-in-my-rake-=
task

in short: does unicorn have anything to do with $HOME or $USER not being =
defined? =46rom what I can tell, that its unicorn is the only thing =
thats different versus running the same ruby via a rails console (which =
does indeed set those shell variables correctly)

in no mans land, so any hep or insight would be greatly appreciated.=20

Thanks,
Russell=
