Hi Eric,

Thanks a bunch for getting back so quickly on this.

I followed your suggestion and tried with `preload_app = false` and
looks like this seems to fix this problem! Any idea what can go wrong
when it's set to true or how I can try go about fixing this??

I haven't yet contacted the logging / logging-rails project. Perhaps
that's a good idea. Considering the gem did/does work fine on my dev
environment and with phusion passenger (and now it seems also with
Unicorn, albeit with preload_app = false), I wasn't sure whether the
problem is with this gem or elsewhere.

Any tips on how to investigate this further or resolve this, or what
information I can give the gem maintainer(s) would be much
appreciated.

Cheers
Yoav
