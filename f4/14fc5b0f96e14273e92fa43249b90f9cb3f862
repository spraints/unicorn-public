Even through nginx?  Which Ruby version is it?

The bug I'm referring to in this thread is only for /request/ headers,
and I don't think any common HTTP clients send trailing whitespace.

I'm sure you're not the only OS X Unicorn user, perhaps somebody else
knows what's going on...

If it's kgio-related, but I think Jeremy fixed all the issues under
OpenBSD with kgio 2.4.0 and some of that probably helped other
*BSD-based systems.  I've been meaning to setup a VM on FreeBSD
again but haven't had the time.
