This is slightly off topic, so I will make this concise, or this can
be taken offline.

What you are talking about, Eric, is exactly the workflow I am working
toward. I am almost there, but still too dependent on the browser. So
2 questions:
1) Would you share what you use for integrations tests for rails and
rack apps in general? (rack test, minitest, capybara, etc.)
2) Are there any resources you would point to going into further detail?

Feel free to respond here or directly, as this is a tangent.

Thanks, Matt
