Thanks for that useful explanation.  Aside from the unnecessary,
"Hi all,", that is an informative commit message which justifies
the usefulness of that patch.

Unfortunately, the commit message in your git repo is lacking.
I've used the text at the top of your email.

Eeep, Evolution does some strange things with formatting
whitespaces.  It looks like instructions for making it nicer are
in the Linux kernel:

I expect code to be wrapped at 80 lines or less.  Fixed locally.
(I need big fonts, even 80 is a compromise, I really prefer 64)

Anyways, pushed to the "rfc2616-sec19.3" branch.

I've also uploaded a prerelease 5.1.0.4.gd5fbb to RubyGems
for folks without Ragel.

	gem install --pre unicorn -v 5.1.0.4.gd5fbb

Anything else?  Expect a 5.2.0 release in a few days or so.
Thanks.
