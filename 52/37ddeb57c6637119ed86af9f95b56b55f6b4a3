This is exactly what happened to us and I should have been clearer. I was=
n=E2=80=99t referring to the default Linux kernel settings causing the ki=

vers and the database server. It only affected certain applications as so=

and the ones that would disconnect were only hit a few times per hour. I =
-believe- we just dropped the keepalive interval on both sides of the fir=
ewall below its idle timeout. =20
