It does. To reproduce the behavior, start a unicorn, start a sniffing
tool (ngrep for example), connect to the unicorn and disconnect
immediately:

Connecting endpoint:

[08:22][virtual] root@infrabox:~# telnet localhost 2002
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to infrabox.virtual.ftnz.net.
Escape character is '^]'.
^]
telnet> quit
Connection closed.

Sniffing Console:

[08:22][virtual] root@infrabox:~# ngrep "" port 2002 -d lo
interface: lo (127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0)
filter: (ip or ip6) and ( port 2002 )
#####
T 127.0.0.1:2002 -> 127.0.0.1:42874 [AFP]
  HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error....
#


Further packet inspection reveals that the 500 Internal Server Error
is sent after the telnet has sent a FIN packet which means it will
just be discarded. I understand logging it could be a DoS vector, but
you must admit that seing 500's from the server without any obvious
reason can be frightening at first.

Re HAProxy, and to complete Laurence reply from my point of view,

That can definitely be a problem in that case. To work around that we
use a cache in the stack above the lower level of HAProxy (we have two
other levels of HAProxy in the stack).
