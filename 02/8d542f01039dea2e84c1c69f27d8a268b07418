Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Changes since 5.0.0:

unicorn 5.0.1 - continuing to violate Rack SPEC

Once again, we allow nil values in response headers.  We've had
this bug since March 2009, and thus cannot expect existing
applications and middlewares running unicorn to fix this.

Unfortunately, supporting this bug contributes to application
server lock-in, but at least we'll document it as such.

Thanks to Owen Ou <o@heroku.com> for reporting this regression:

Additionally, systemd examples are now in the examples/ directory
