This is not anything new, just documenting what has been going
on since the beginning.

There's been a small number of generic networking (or mm) bugs in
the kernel which affect unicorn, but are usually found and fixed
with more popular, non-Ruby servers, first.

Aside from generic performance problems, I don't think there's ever
been a glibc bug which affected unicorn.

+== Bugs in related projects
+
+unicorn is sometimes affected by bugs in its dependencies.  Bugs
+triggered by unicorn in mainline Ruby, rack, GNU C library (glibc),
+or the Linux kernel will be reported upstream and fixed.
+
+For bugs in Ruby itself, we may forward bugs to
+https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/ and discuss+fix them on the ruby-core
+list at mailto:ruby-core@ruby-lang.org
+Subscription to post is required to ruby-core, unfortunately:
+mailto:ruby-core-request@ruby-lang.org?subject=subscribe
+
+For uncommon bugs in Rack, we may forward bugs to
+mailto:rack-devel@googlegroups.com and discuss there.
+Subscription (without any web UI or Google account) is possible via:
+mailto:rack-devel+subscribe@googlegroups.com
+Note: not everyone can use the proprietary bug tracker used by Rack,
+but their mailing list remains operational.
+
+Uncommon bugs we encounter in the Linux kernel should be Cc:-ed to the
+Linux kernel mailing list (LKML) at mailto:linux-kernel@vger.kernel.org
+and other kernel lists such as mailto:netdev@vger.kernel.org
+(for networking issues).  No subscription is necessary, and the our
+mailing list follows the same conventions as LKML for interopability.
+
+Likewise for any rare glibc bugs we might encounter, we should Cc:
+mailto:libc-alpha@sourceware.org
+Keep in mind glibc upstream does use Bugzilla for tracking bugs:
+https://sourceware.org/bugzilla/
