Google Groups get more spam, and last I checked there's no way to
download mail archives easily other than scraping the site.

The Rubyforge at least has that, but the searchability sucks (so we
mirror to gmane/mail-archive).

Librelist is nice, but didn't exist when I started this project and at
this point the pain of migration is more than the benefit.  I'll
consider Librelist if there's strong support on the mailing list here.

Where does it say that?  I usually wrap my replies at 72 characters, but
there should be nothing in the mailman config that prevents longer lines
from being posted (and some patches do go longer than 80 due to the +/-
prefixes).  Of course HTML email is hugely wasteful and that's not
allowed here.
