Just wanted to say thanks for the reply - I've been trying to figure
this out over the weekend and not succeeding.  I can't seem to
reproduce it in a self-contained environment, it only ever happens in
production, which is making debugging a bit frustrating...

99% sure it doesn't - it just sits there in a zombie state with no
workers.  But I want to verify that, so I guess I'm stuck waiting
until it happens in production again.  Will let you know.
