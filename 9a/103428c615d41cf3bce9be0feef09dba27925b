Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.2.0 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and *nix
Message-ID: <20161031200456.GA10198@dcvr>

unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Changes:

    Most notably, this release allows us to support requests with
    lines delimited by LF-only, as opposed to the standard CRLF
    pair and allowed by RFC 2616 sec 19.3.

    Thanks to Mishael A Sibiryakov for the explanation and change:

    Thanks to Let's Encrypt, the website also moves to HTTPS
    <https://bogomips.org/unicorn/> to improve reader privacy.  The
    "unicorn.bogomips.org" subdomain will be retired soon to reduce
    subjectAltName bloat and speed up certificate renewals.

    There's also the usual round of documentation and example
    updates, too.

    Eric Wong (7):
          examples/init.sh: update to reduce upgrade raciness
          doc: systemd should only kill master in example
          examples/logrotate.conf: update example for systemd
          doc: update gmane URLs to point to our own archives
          relocate website to https://bogomips.org/unicorn/
          TODO: remove Rack 2.x item
          build: "install-gem" target avoids network

    Mishael A Sibiryakov (1):
          Add some tolerance (RFC2616 sec. 19.3)
