nginx doens't have the same problem as I show later. Even if it I
restart/reload nginx very infrequently. Unicorn has to be hot restarted
every time we change our application code and happens frequently.

nginx does not explicitly unlink the old pid file before it renames it
out of the way so yes matching nginx in that regard changes the behavior
exactly how I originally asked but you were against that. Maybe the
point is moot though.

This is from a combo of USR2, WINCH, QUIT sent from htop to the master
process:

2012-11-27 01:44:25 +0200
[:moved_from, :move]
"nginx.pid"
2012-11-27 01:44:25 +0200
[:moved_to, :move]
"nginx.pid.oldbin"
2012-11-27 01:44:25 +0200
[:create]
"nginx.pid"
2012-11-27 01:44:25 +0200
[:open]
"nginx.pid"
2012-11-27 01:44:25 +0200
[:modify]
"nginx.pid"
2012-11-27 01:44:25 +0200
[:close_write, :close]
"nginx.pid"
2012-11-27 01:45:31 +0200
[:delete]
"nginx.pid.oldbin"

The window here is much smaller than for the current unicorn behavior.

Petteri
