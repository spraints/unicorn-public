Hello,

I've been working for a few days on a problem which, after tracking it
down, seems to be related to unicorn.  I'm hoping that somebody might
be able to help with information about what's going on.

In the Rails 3 application that I support, we sometimes fork during a
web request in order to do background processing behind the scenes
without the user (and the browser connection) to wait for it to
finish.  I realize that a better method would be to have a queue of
jobs to be processed (I even created a gem called job_boss which works
well for our case), but it will take us a while to get there, so I'm
trying to fix this for now.

The problem that I'm finding is that, when I fork, the HTTP connection
doesn't close.  IE doesn't handle this as well and the browser is left
sitting, waiting for the child process to finish rather than being
redirected.  This functionality worked fine in our application when we
were using Rails 2.3.5 and Unicorn 1.1.3, but broke when we moved to
Rails 3 and Unicorn 3.0.0 (we've since moved to Unicorn 3.4.0 and the
problem remains, I had some hope that Unicorn 3.3.1 might have
addressed it).

I've been able to solve this problem temporarily by closing two file
descriptors manually (#3 and, depending on the version of Rails #6 or
#7).  Obviously this is not ideal.  I found the UNICORN_FD environment
variable when looking through the Unicorn source, but that only seems
to indicate #3.  Where might #6/#7 be coming from?  Is there some way
that I can determine these without hard-coding the FD #?

Any help that you can provide would be greatly appreciated,
Brian Underwood
