Is it something you'd be willing to change? The developers behind
resque reasoned in a similar way in regards to nginx but changed it
after a while. You can read more about it here
<https://github.com/resque/resque/issues/368> and in the referenced
issues.

The change i'd like to see is to preferably have SIGTERM and SIGQUIT
swap places but at least move SIGTERM to do the same thing as SIGQUIT
do now (graceful exit).

I may be wrong but i feel that the change shouldn't completely break
anything (since it would still exit, just take a bit longer) and
switching some signals around in the nginx scripts shouldn't be that
much work? Also some people are probably using SIGINT already and
wouldn't be affected. I think the benefit in the long run of being in
line with the "standard" outweighs the hassle of converting a few
scripts.

Also perhaps with some luck the nginx developers will pick on the
changes in other software and switch theirs around too!

Thanks for a really great tool anyway!

Andreas
