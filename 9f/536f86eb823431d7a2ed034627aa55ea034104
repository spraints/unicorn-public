Fair enough.  Would you/Phusion be comfortable taking the lead here?
This feels like another "hot potato" issue :>

Perhaps we need to educate users to set LC_CTYPE/LC_ALL/LANG so
Encoding.default_external works as intended?  Adding another
option to Rack will just as likely to get missed.

Maybe servers could emit a big warning saying:

    WARNING: Encoding.default_external is not UTF-8 ...

And add a --quiet-utf8-warning option for the few folks who really do
not want UTF-8.
