If possible, I would like to avoid an option and rely on
Encoding.default_external in a new major version.  Too many ways to set
the same thing is confusing and requires extra documentation overhead.

I might start with WEBrick (or the Rack/WEBrick handler).  WEBrick is
distributed with Ruby and maintained by the core team.  It's not used in
production much, but it the reference implementation which is usable
from all Ruby implementations.

naruse (from that rack-devel thread) is also active in Ruby core and
is very knowledgeable in these areas.

Definitely get other Rack folks to chime in, even if it is a
unicorn-only change.  This has been a problem for years already,
so taking more time to get things right won't hurt.
