(oops, missed this earlier)

I understand olddoc may not be worth the effort to package in
Debian.  (I already tried to reduce dependencies in olddoc
compared to wrongdoc, but a package is a package...)

Anyways, I suggest you guys grab the generated gemspec from the
Rubygem or tar.gz.  You already seem to be doing that with NEWS
and the manpages to avoid a build-dep on pandoc(*).

Maybe the gemspec in git could have olddoc become optional, too,
while still remaining DRY.  The email address for the public
mailing list is already specified in multiple places, so maybe
over-DRY-ing isn't worth it...

Anyways, feel free to email me + Cc: unicorn-public@bogomips.org
w.r.t. any packaging/integration issues for any Free Software
systems (not just Debian)


(*) - I'll be switching over to perlpod at some point and
      pod2man is standard in Debian.  I hate having to spend
      ~30MB of bandwidth fees to get ghc + pandoc to build
      manpages.
