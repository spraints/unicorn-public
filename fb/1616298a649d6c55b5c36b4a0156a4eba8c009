As I'm sure you've all heard by now, RubyForge will be moving to a
read-only state and we'll have to migrate our mailing lists somewhere.

== librelist

I'm leaning strongly towards librelist.com.  I've had good, but limited
experiences with it.  I like that librelist has no logins or accounts to
deal with; just email the list you want to join and reply to the
automated message to subscribe.  It also has downloadable archives
via rsync.

librelist is run by Zed Shaw, the same guy who started Mongrel (which
eventually led us to Unicorn).  While I don't believe in giving any
single entity too much power and influence, Zed's done a lot of good for
Mongrel and handed it off gracefully when he didn't want to work on it
anymore.  For these reason, I think librelist will be in good hands for
years to come.

I probably would've picked librelist if it had been around when I
started this RubyForge list in May 2009.  I started Rainbows! more
recently, but continued using RubyForge because I wanted everything
Rainbows!-related on RubyForge.org (oops!).


== Other options

Google Groups is out.  Spam has been a big problem in the few groups
I've joined and I'd rather trust Zed than Google for mailing lists.
Also I don't know of a way to get archives from Google without scraping.

SourceForge - I've had spam problems in the past, mailman...

Savannah - no idea about the quality, but uses mailman...

I've also considered hosting the list ourselves, but that might be
too much work and spreading ourselves too thin at the moment.


Any other list hosting options out there we should consider?  It must be
a mailing list that does not mangle plain-text patches.

Or any votes in favor of migrating to librelist sooner rather than
later?  I'll work on getting the gmane NNTP mirrors moved over as
well.


== Other stuff related to RubyForge going read-only...

Gem hosting will (obviously) be taken care of by our new
Gemcut^WRubygems.org overlords.

The tarballs for non-RubyGems users will probably just be moved to a
files/ section of the websites; it'll be even be easier to find and
download tarballs in automated scripts that way, too.

Since we're using git, our repositories are mirrored everywhere already
and was never centrally-hosted on RubyForge in the first place.

http://rainbows.rubyforge.org/ will probably be redirected to
http://rainbows.bogomips.org/ (same box as the Unicorn website).

Should you ever want to access either of the sites offline, just make
sure you have RDoc 2.4.x ("gem install rdoc" if you're on 1.8) and run
`make doc' or `gmake doc' in the latest source tree.
