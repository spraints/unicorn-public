Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.5.1 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and
Message-ID: <20190506065027.tafvi5uhdh6fzndb@dcvr>

unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Disclaimer:

Due to its ability to tolerate crashes and isolate clients, unicorn
is unfortunately known to prolong the existence of bugs in applications
and libraries which run on top of it.

This release fixes and works around issues from v5.5.0 (2019-03-04)

Stephen Demjanenko worked around a pipe resource accounting bug
present in old Linux kernels.  Linux 3.x users from 3.16.57 and
on are unaffected.  Linux 4.x users from 4.9 and on are
unaffected.

Stan Pitucha reported a bug with the old `unicorn_rails' wrapper
(intended for Rails 2.x users) which was promptly fixed by
Jeremy Evans:

There's also some doc updates to warn users off `unicorn_rails';
the homepage is now energy-efficient for OLEDs and CRTs;
and I'm no longer advertising mailing list subscriptions
(because I hate centralization and mail archives are the priority)

Eric Wong (3):
      doc: unicorn_rails: clarify that it is intended for rails <= 2.x
      doc: stop advertising mailing list subscription
      doc: switch homepage to dark216

Jeremy Evans (1):
      unicorn_rails: fix regression with Rails >= 3.x in app build

Stephen Demjanenko (1):
      Rescue failed pipe resizes due to permissions
