It's not worth mentioning pre-Rack versions of Rails anymore,
and there are a few async Rack applications reliant on
EventMachine which we do not use.

Some uses of chunked request decoding are not well-handled
with nginx in front, anyways; so avoid mentioning them.

Additionally, avoid introducing new terms into the lexicon
and just refer to "mailing list" as a generic term.
