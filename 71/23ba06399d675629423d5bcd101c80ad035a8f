AR disconnect! is idempotent and has been since unicorn existed.
I suspect most other things people run in before_fork are already
idempotent, too.

Using the local 'master_run' variable in your before_fork already
accomplishes everything you needed, right?

I try to keep unicorn as lean as possible and not bloat it with
redundant features.  The current hooks already fulfill the minimal
requirements for supporting apps which do not behave properly under
preload_app=true, so I am not convinced why a new hook is necessary.
