Thanks Eric,

I think I might have found a solution :)

There was a hint in the config file I had for the logging-rails gem:

  if defined?(PhusionPassenger)
    PhusionPassenger.on_event(:starting_worker_process) do |forked|
      Logging.reopen if forked
    end
  end

I simply added `Logging.reopen` to the after_fork block and now it
looks like it's working again!

Not sure I still fully (or even partially) understand what's going on
there, but at least it's working.

Thanks again for your help.

Cheers
Yoav
