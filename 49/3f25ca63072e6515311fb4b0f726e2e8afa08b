Hi Peter,

Set stderr_path in your unicorn config file so Unicorn can log
its errors to a file.  Otherwise Unicorn will send all errors to
/dev/null when daemonized.

I shall emphasize the importance of stderr_path if you're using the
default logger configuration in the documentation.

Any chance the "/post/18Vmy" request is hitting your timeout?  The only
way you can know is if Unicorn logged its errors.  You might also want
to check your Rails log for exceptions, too, as some uncaught errors
may show up there.
