Ahah, seems like an old problem with bundler defaults.

Actually, "bundle exec --keep-file-descriptors" should work
nowadays.  See patch below.

No problem.

*shrug* I prefer to use full the full path to the config file
which would already include the app name in it:

	unicorn -c /path/to/my_app/unicorn.conf.rb ...

Subject: [PATCH] doc: reference --keep-file-descriptors for "bundle exec"

"bundle exec" alone is not suitable for use with systemd-style
socket activation due to Ruby 2.0+ behavior of setting close-on-exec
for file descriptors above 2.  However, the "--keep-file-descriptors"
option was added to bundler 1.4.0 to workaround this Ruby 2.0 change
and may be used to prevent Ruby 2.0+ from closing file descriptors
on exec.

Thanks to Amir Yalon and Christos Trochalakis for bringing up
this issue on the mailing list:
