No, they remained owned by root.

That would probably be better behavior, although in this specific case the worker would immediately die on respawn because the log is still owned by root and unwriteable by my unprivileged user.

I did find a resolution: in the after_fork block, I had copied the code to switch users from the GitHub blog post on unicorn (https://github.com/blog/517-unicorn). I didn't see Unicorn::Worker#user, which implements the same code with the addition of a call to Unicorn::Util.chown_logs. When I replace the inline GitHub-blog-derived code with a call to Unicorn::Worker#user, it works. 

My understanding is that this (after_fork/Unicorn::Util.chown_logs) shouldn't be executed on USR1; I don't see how the Unicorn::Util.chown_logs call on after_fork (startup) would make a difference w/r/t rotation (much later), but my understanding is obviously incomplete, because it works.

Thanks for your reply, I'm off to comment on the GitHub blog post to try to warn others to use Unicorn::Worker#user instead of the example code in after_fork.
