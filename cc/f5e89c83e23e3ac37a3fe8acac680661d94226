Great points. Most of what I do are simple deployments. I haven't
experimented with memcached, etc. that would benefit from a capistrano
style deployment. This also works better in Sinatra than in Rails for
limiting downtime because the restart is typically quicker.

For most of what I do Capistrano is too much. So I like the simplicity here.

For production only configuration I don't have that checked into
source control. It exists on the server only and ignored in the
.gitignore file (as does most of my custom development config). There
are some things in source control that gets pushed to the server -
such as tests, etc.

And just to be clear, I'm not anti Capistrano. I just like to keep
things as simple as possible. For a large system the git hook won't
work. But for a small system Capistrano is (typically) too much.
