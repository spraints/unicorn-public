Hi guys. Phusion Passenger author here. I would very much support
standardization of encoding issues. Every now and then, a user submits
a bug report on Phusion Passenger, mentioning an encoding problem. The
user would say that the problem occurs on Phusion Passenger but not on
Unicorn/Thin/etc. The Rack spec doesn't say anything about encodings
so strictly speaking it's not "our fault", but it's still hard to tell
users that it's "their fault" or "their framework's fault" based on
this alone. It's also not a helpful answer: users often have no idea
what to do about the issue.

At this point, I don't really care what the standard is, as long as
it's a sane standard that everybody can follow.

In my opinion, following Encoding.default_external is not helpful.
Most users have absolutely no idea how to configure
Encoding.default_external, or even know that it exists. I've also
never, ever seen anybody who does *not* want default_external to be
UTF-8. If it's not set to UTF-8, then it's always by accident (e.g.
the user not knowing that it depends on LC_CTYPE, that LC_CTYPE is set
differently in the shell than from an init script, or even what
LC_CTYPE is).
