Thank you very much for taking a look at this.  I was going to do it
myself over the summer.

I ran into some problems with our tests forking + minitest/autorun
causing some problems due to at_exit usage.

We probably need to workaround, I already did something for yahns
which we can reuse[1] in unicorn.

For yahns, I did the following:
----------- git://yhbt.net/yahns -- test/helper.rb ------------------
gem 'minitest'
begin # favor minitest 5
  require 'minitest'
  Testcase = Minitest::Test
  mtobj = Minitest
rescue NameError, LoadError # but support minitest 4
  require 'minitest/unit'
  Testcase = Minitest::Unit::TestCase
  mtobj = MiniTest::Unit.new
end

# Not using minitest/autorun because that doesn't guard against redundant
# extra runs with fork.  We cannot use exit! in the tests either
# (since users/apps hosted on yahns _should_ expect exit, not exit!).
TSTART_PID = $$
at_exit do
  # skipping @@after_run stuff in minitest since we don't need it
  case $!
  when nil, SystemExit
    exit(mtobj.run(ARGV)) if $$ == TSTART_PID
  end
end
-------------------------------- 8< -------------------------------
I'd appreciate a second opinion on what I did with yahns above,
but it should work with unicorn.

Can you take a look at integrating+fixing those cases which fork?
Thanks again.

No problem.  Also keeping unicorn-public@bogomips.org Cc-ed since that's
the new public-inbox[2] address and reply-all will be the norm there.
Hopefully public-inbox can encourage more drive-by contributors like
you :)
