Man, your answer is detailed. Thanks.

The PID 11587 was indeed for the worker process.

FD 7 might be a connection to NewRelic over HTTPS.

This app is doing a lot : connections to Redis, MySQL, Memcached, =E2=80=A6
It uses Ruby 2.1.5.


If those EAGAIN are probably expected, I wouldn't dig deeper.
I'm definitely not in my comfort zone here and wanted to be sure that
there were not an elephant in the room that I couldn't see.

I'll try to put some warn() in the code at the beginning and end of
the request cycle to see if something shows up.


Thank you very much for your time and help.
