Lawrence,

I've suspected that it may be a monitoring problem and not a Unicorn
problem, but I'm not yet convinced either way. Our monitoring via
collectd is done through Rightscale. They have a lot of experience
with EC2, so I'd assume that it is monitoring properly. Also, our
other services (mysql, for example) are showing activity on multiple
cores under load, so that leads me to believe that the monitoring is
working in at least some cases.

I wasn't aware of the Cloudwatch service until now, that looks
interesting ... I'll check it out.

Anyone else experience a problem like this?

Nate
