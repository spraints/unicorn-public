I might wait a week for others to chime in before making an official
release.  However, packaging your own gem should be relatively easy
and it is documented in the HACKING file.

I'm against adding too many configuration variables as it's difficult to
support (needs documentation, testing, including testing for corner
cases, error handling, etc...).  Too many exposed configuration values
scares off new users.

Given how few people have an issue with these values, I don't think it's
worth the effort.
