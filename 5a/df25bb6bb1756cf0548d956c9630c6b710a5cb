Subject: nginx-like reverse proxies as a "sponge"?

Lately, I've caught myself refering to reverse proxies like
nginx as a "sponge" to soak up requests/responses in between
the app server and slow clients.

Perhaps it's easier to use the term "sponge" drive home the point
that unicorn should never be exposed to slow clients?

Anyways it's still disappointing that people still use unicorn
with no proxy at all or proxies that can't completely buffer
everything.


And perhaps nginx needs some competition as a sponge for unicorn:
