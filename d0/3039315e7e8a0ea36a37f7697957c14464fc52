Not really, aside from the OobGC change and hijack test removal.

Anyways, I've squashed the test removal, OobGC adjustment, and
your 2nd patch together as commit c917ac526df214611ec33c21de2b070452ec8434
and pushed it out as the "v6-wip" branch.

Yes, though there are also some other HTTP servers that use the
parser.  I prefer to minimize changes to the ext code at this
point given the relative lack of C/Ragel-knowledgeable users
