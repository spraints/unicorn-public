That sounds like a good plan then. Once there=E2=80=99s a new version we =
can
bump that on our side to remove the manual patch then.

Ah, that=E2=80=99s a very good point. I think that would also have been =
a valid
approach but it does indeed add more allocations. If that approach would
be preferred, I think it can also be changed to that?

I don=E2=80=99t really have a strong preference on which approach to =

Nope, looks like some platform behavior changes (tried on MacOS first).
I was able to get the tests running and working on Debian Buster this
morning before I sent a new version of the patch and they are all =
passing
there for me locally.
