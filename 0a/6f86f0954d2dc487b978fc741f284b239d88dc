Hello all,

I'm quite amazed of how preloading and fork and reduce memory usage.
Making it use even less memory and restarting the app faster, the next
step would be incorporate other daemons (also part of the app, in my
case delayed_job and feed-updater) AS unicorn workers.

This would be very interesting as restarting unicorn would also
restart these daemons.
Another benefit of incorporating daemons into unicorn is sharing pidfile.

For it to work properly I would have to reserve some workers for these
daemons. Today, I would simple do a condition on worker.nr and apply a
specific code to start the daemon. Maybe better would be to have a
different type of worker designed for this.

But something I don't know how to do is to disable http requests to be
forwared to these workers. How could I do it?

Have you ever thought in doing this?

best regards,
