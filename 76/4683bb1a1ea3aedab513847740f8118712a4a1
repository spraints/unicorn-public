Subject: [ANN] unicorn 6.0.0 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and *nix

unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Changes:

    unicorn 6.0.0 - no more recycling Rack env
    
    This release allocates a new Rack `env' hash for every request.
    This is done for safety with internally-(thread|event)-using Rack
    apps which expect to use `env' after the normal Rack response is
    complete, but without relying on rack.hijack[1].  Thanks to
    Dirkjan Bussink <d.bussink@gmail.com> for the patch:
    
      https://yhbt.net/unicorn-public/66A68DD8-83EF-4C7A-80E8-3F1F7AB31670@github.com/
    
    The major version is bumped since:
    
    1) there are performance regressions for some simple Rack apps
    
    2) unsupported 3rd-party monkey patches which previously
       relied on this behavior may be broken (our version of
       OobGC was).
    
    The test suite is also more reliable on multi-core systems
    and Ruby 3.x.
