Btw, rack 1.6 (when released) should have a native warmup method thanks
to Aman.  It's currently in rack.git.

You do not need to sleep before warmup.

The master never pushes requests to a worker.  The key to unicorn is the
workers pull requests directly from the kernel queue.  The master is
never involved with distributing requests to the worker.


On a side note, your config is depressingly long and complex :<
Try to make your apps run well without needing unicorn-worker-killer,
at least...
