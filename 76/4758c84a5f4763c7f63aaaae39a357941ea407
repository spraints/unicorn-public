unicorn isn't appropriate for long-running responses (taking up an
entire process is expensive), it is designed for fast responses to a
fast client able to read it quickly.

Using Rack::Timeout with Rainbows! instead of unicorn is probably a
better idea.

That'd be more expensive for the common case of fast responses
(which is what unicorn is designed for)
