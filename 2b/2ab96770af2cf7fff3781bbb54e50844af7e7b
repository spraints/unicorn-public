Subject: [ANN] unicorn 5.1.0 - Rack HTTP server for fast clients and *nix

Unicorn is an HTTP server for Rack applications designed to only serve
fast clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections and take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully buffering
both the the request and response in between unicorn and slow clients.

Changes:

    unicorn 5.1.0 - rack is optional, again

    Note: no code changes since 5.1.0.pre1 from January.^WNo, wait,
    last minute performance improvement added today.  See below.

    The big change is rack is not required (but still recommended).
    Applications are expected to depend on rack on their own so they can
    specify the version of rack they prefer without unicorn pulling
    in a newer, potentially incompatible version.

    unicorn will always attempt to work with multiple versions of rack
    as practical.

    The HTTP parser also switched to using the TypedData C-API for
    extra type safety and memory usage accounting support in the
    'objspace' extension.

    Thanks to Adam Duke to bringing the rack change to our attention
    and Aaron Patterson for helping with the matter.

    Last minute change: we now support the new leftpad() syscall under
    Linux for major performance and security improvements:

          doc: bump olddoc to ~> 1.2 for extra NNTP URL
          rack is optional at runtime, required for dev
          doc update for ClientShutdown exceptions class
          unicorn 5.1.0.pre1 - rack is optional, again
          doc: reference --keep-file-descriptors for "bundle exec"
          doc: further trimming to reduce noise
          use leftpad Linux syscall for speed!
