Unicorn is a HTTP server for Rack applications designed to take
advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like kernels and only serve fast
clients on low-latency, high-bandwidth connections.  Slow clients should
only be served by placing a reverse proxy capable of fully-buffering
both the the request and response in between Unicorn and slow clients.

Thanks to Chris Wanstrath for reporting issues with large
POST bodies and for helping me test.

Changes:

Avoid truncated POST bodies with URL-encoded forms in Rails
by switching TeeInput to use read-in-full semantics (only) when
a Content-Length: header exists.  Chunked request bodies
continue to exhibit readpartial semantics to support
simultaneous bidirectional chunking.

The lack of return value checking in Rails to protect against a
short ios.read(length) is entirely reasonable even if not
pedantically correct.  Most ios.read(length) implementations
return the full amount requested except right before EOF.

A ticket has been opened here to track the issue:
  https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3343

Also there are some minor documentation improvements.

Eric Wong (8):
      Fix NEWS generation on single-paragraph tag messages
      Include GPLv2 in docs
      doc: make it clear contributors retain copyrights
      TODO: removed Rainbows! (see rainbows.rubyforge.org)
      Document the START_CTX hash contents
      more-compatible TeeInput#read for POSTs with Content-Length
      tests for read-in-full vs readpartial semantics
      unicorn 0.93.2
