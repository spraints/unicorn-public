From anecdotes on ruby-core, clang still seems less aggressive
at optimizations than modern gcc.

Fwiw, a few GC bugs in Ruby trunk got fixed recently and the
fixes should be in 2.4.2 (soon):
https://public-inbox.org/ruby-core/?q=T_NONE+d%3A20161225..20170808

Not identical to T_NODE which Pere got, but if it's a GC bug,
but both T_NONE and T_NODE triggers are symptoms of GC bugs.
