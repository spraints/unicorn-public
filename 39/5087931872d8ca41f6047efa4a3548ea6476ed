We upgraded nginx from 1.4.7 to 1.6.2.  The frequency of the error has
increased significantly since.  But I hesitate to point the finger at
nginx without more evidence, since its developers are very skilled.

uname -3.13.0-40-generic #69~precise1-Ubuntu

Ruby 2.1.1

I'll take that step later if I have to, but I'm not sure what evidence
that would provide, since we're not having timeout issues -- when this
happens, the response time reported by nginx is usually just a few
seconds (Unicorn timeout is 90 seconds),
