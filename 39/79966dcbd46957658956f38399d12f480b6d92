If nginx developers are willing to change this, definitely.

Otherwise, at this point, I'm not certain what the ramifications of a
change would be to existing users.  Maybe an option would work, but too
many options overwhelms people.

With unicorn, I suppose having the following after_fork hook works:

   # Note: after_fork hook is run before the :QUIT handler is installed,
   # so we can't use the result of trap(:QUIT) at this point:
   after_fork do |server,worker|
     trap(:TERM) { Process.kill(:QUIT, $$) }
   end

If I had to do this all over again[1], graceful shutdown would be the
_only_ option.
