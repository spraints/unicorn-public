Ugh.  This is what I feared...  Slow startup time of most Ruby web apps
doesn't help.

Is there an alternate way to monitor unicorn with monit?
But I'd like to keep your case working if possible.

How about having the old process create a hard link to .oldbin,
and having the new one override the pid if Process.ppid == pid file?
The check is still racy, but that's what pid files are :<
