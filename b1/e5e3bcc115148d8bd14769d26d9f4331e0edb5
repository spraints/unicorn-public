There's no way I would remove this feature or any other
feature other people rely on.  Just pushed this out:

    Revert "remove response_start_sent"
    
    Oops, this was a half-baked change I was considering
    but forgot about.
    
    This reverts commit 69fd4f9bbff3708166fbf70163fa6e192dde1497.

commit 69fd4f9bbff3708166fbf70163fa6e192dde1497 was the start of
a reorganization that I ultimately abandoned, at least for now.
