We may finally start deprecating OobGC, as it looks like incremental
GC[1] is working well in ruby-trunk and will make it into the Ruby
2.2.0-preview1 release (should be out soon).

I've been running unicorn.bogomips.org on ruby-trunk for most of the
year without problems, and hte past few weeks with incremental GC.
However, keep in mind I mainly serve static files (served by extras/* in
yahns.git[2]) and don't use lot of heavy-weight code.

If you find bugs in ruby-trunk itself, please report them to the
https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/ issue tracker.  That has ruby-core ML
integration[3]) so I can take a look at them.  Thanks.
