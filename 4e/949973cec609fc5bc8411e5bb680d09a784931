Subject: Re: Why Unicorn master process memory increasing

Hi Eric,

Sorry for my late response, somehow missed your mail. Just to update I
managed to fix the issue, it was related to GC. We were using
unciron's oob_gc to control gc execution. Although we had correct
configuration for oob_gc but somehow it was not allowing GC to run. I
checked GC stat and found that major & minor GC count is consistent
over the time. I removed oob_gc and now using gctools gem. With
gctools gem master memory is consistent to ~400MB.

Thanks a lot for your help.

Regards,
Sumit
