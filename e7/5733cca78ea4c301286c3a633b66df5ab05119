wrongdoc was difficult to maintain because of the tidy-ffi
dependency and the HTML5 changes in Darkfish could not be
handled well by Tidy.

olddoc is superior as it generates leaner HTML which loads faster,
requires less scrolling and less processing power to render.
Aesthetic comparisons are subjective of course but completely
unimportant compared to speed and accessibility.

The presence of images and CSS on the old (Darkfish-based) site
probably set unreasonable expectations as to my ability and
willingness to view such things.  No more, the new website is
entirely simple HTML which renders well with even the wimpiest
browser.
