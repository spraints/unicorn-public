Right, it's been rejected several times before:

Again, I don't want to encourage lazy app development or Rack apps
written with only unicorn in mind.

Existing `timeout' feature of unicorn is already something I hate
and don't want to encourage further reliance on:

	https://bogomips.org/unicorn/Application_Timeouts.html

Fwiw, I (with ruby-core) will try to make Timeout in ruby stdlib
have less overhead for 2.6 (or 2.7) so it can benefit more users
than just unicorn.  Ditto with various OobGC hacks over the years.

Thanks.
