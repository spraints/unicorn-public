DRb can bind to UNIX domain sockets, too.  But ask yourself:

  Is your app really so broken that you always need DRb running on it?

You may also want to checkout Hijack, I haven't used/needed it myself,
but it could be interesting if an app is really in a lot of trouble:

rescuing EADDRINUSE in a loop is also how the "listen" directive
implements the :tries/:delay parameters.

Mainly it was cleaner and easier to test/implement it the way it is now.
It's also easier for somebody testing a setup to toggle it from the
command line.

I actually didn't want to support --daemonize at all since setsid(8),
is standard most GNU/Linux distros nowadays, but we support more than
just GNU/Linux.

No problem.
