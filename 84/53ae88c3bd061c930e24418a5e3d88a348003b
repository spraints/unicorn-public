OK, I'll push out an nginx example in a bit, need to make sure things
are adequately explained and linked.

max_fails doesn't seem to have any effect when fail_timeout=0.  Setting
max_fails=0 means the same thing as fail_timeout=0 in nginx >=0.6.33
(it would segfault before :x)  I've just been using fail_timeout=0
since what seems like forever in nginx...

Reading ngx_http_upstream_round_robin.c again, it appears seems that
fail_timeout/max_fails is supposed to get ignored if *all* upstreams are
failing.  So if you have a single upstream it looks like you're safe
even if your Unicorn master nukes workers.  On the other hand I remember
this not being the case at some point a while back; an entire cluster
got effectively shut down because of it.  Just set fail_timeout=0
and stop worrying about it :)
