Hello,

Unicorn=E2=80=99s homepage (http://unicorn.bogomips.org/) seems to have =
lost CSS and JS.

Is it because of the shutdown of Rubyforge?
E.g. the content was moved elsewhere, but the darkfish rdoc template was =
provided by Rubyforge?
I can=E2=80=99t remember if it was hosted there or not.

Is anyone already working on the issue?
If not, do you need any help?

Cheers,
Tom=
