Subject: [PATCH] explain 11 byte magic number for self-pipe

Oops, this should've been explained long ago but apparently not.

In response to a comment on
http://www.sitepoint.com/the-self-pipe-trick-explained/

> Does anybody know why both unicorn and foreman read 11 bytes from
> self-pipe?

Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to comment on the site on a
JavaScript-free browser nor does it seem possible without
registering.

Again, anybody can send plain-text mail to:
unicorn-public@bogomips.org

No registration, no real name policy, no terms-of-service, just
plain-text.  Feel free to use Tor, mixmaster or any anonymity
service, too.
