As your friendly neighborhood service engineer, my experience is that
separating the concerns (keeping asynchronous processors separate from your
synchronouous web services) is worth the additional memory and processor
cost.  The two usually don't scale at the same rate, and you want to keep
your failure domains separate as well: you don't want a bug in the async
processor cause your web server to crash as well.   And let's not even get
into the programming and maintenance challenges.

There is such as thing as being too cheap. :)
