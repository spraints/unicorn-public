Yes, but perhaps Rainbows! (a sister project of unicorn) is better
<http://rainbows.rubyforge.org/> since it has less overhead when
waiting for a big CGI to run.  If performance/scalability isn't
an issue, then unicorn is fine for CGI.  unicorn is much easier
to configure as there's less documentation to read :)

You can check out rack-legacy git://github.com/eric1234/rack-legacy

I've never used rack-legacy, as I've been running the bundled
Unicorn::App::ExecCGI before with cgit <http://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/>.
I haven't used it on anything but cgit, however.

I use the following for serving http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git

(I run this with Rainbows!, but it's fine with unicorn, too)
------------------------ config.ru ------------------------
require "unicorn/app/exec_cgi"
map("http://bogomips.org/") do
  repo = "/path/to/my/git/repos/on/bogomips.org"
  cgit = Unicorn::App::ExecCgi.new("#{repo}/cgit.cgi")

  # Attempts static file serving with Rack::File, first.
  # Fall back to calling cgit if the URL matches .git
  # Otherwise, just return a 404
  r404 = [ 404, [ %w(Content-Length 0), %w(Content-Type text/plain) ], [] ]
  cgit_wrap = lambda { |e| e["PATH_INFO"] =~ %r{\.git} ? cgit.call(e) : r404 }
  run Rack::Cascade.new([ Rack::File.new(repo), cgit_wrap ])
end
