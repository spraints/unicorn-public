Done!  (I think the confirmation should've gone through, Rubyforge has
been acting funny...).  Anyways it's common practice on many FOSS
mailing lists to Cc: all parties (but not Ruby-related lists,
unfortunately...)[1]

There's been some talk of it if you search the mailing list archives for

:x

I posted this the other day but haven't gotten much feedback on it:

[1] Fwiw, I prefer Cc: to all anyways.  It's easier to rope in folks for
    issues that aren't isolated to the project at hand.
