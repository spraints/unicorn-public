Hello,

While reading the article at
http://www.sitepoint.com/the-self-pipe-trick-explained/ I realized
that the signal handling code shown there and of the same type in your
application is broken.  As you have a single nonblocking pipe in your
application you can drop signals entirely (and not just fold multiple
signals of the same type into one).  The simplest fix is to use a pipe
for each individual type of signal or to just use pselect or similar.
I'm pretty sure that there is a way to use a single pipe but it seems
complicated and very difficult to implement correctly.

Thank you,
Steven Stewart-Gallus
